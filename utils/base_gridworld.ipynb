Even if you were about as good as gw7x7-10-30 you still might want to read this book. A deep understanding of the optimization processes that shape behaviour in simple organism-environment systems like this one will allow for generalization to more intricate systems, specifically, a rich understanding of how brains generate adaptive behaviour as a result of optimization processes."
