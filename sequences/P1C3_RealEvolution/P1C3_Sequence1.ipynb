        "### Objective: We concluded the last chapter by discussing how neuroscience has traditionally focused on neural mechanisms of behaviour. While neural ontogeny has also been a focus of neuroscience we argued that even greater focus on ontogeny could benefit both brain and behavioural sciences. Evolutionary thinking underpins this argument, and frames the brain as an evolved tool for rapid adaption. To fully grasp this perspective, we first need to undertand the core principles of evolutionary theory. Our aim here is to set out and explore these core principles of evolution through simple examples.\n",

        "* Outline the fundamental concepts of evolution and natural selection:\n",
        "  1. Identify the Key Players in Evolution:\n",
        "    * Populations and Individuals: The collective and singular units of evolution. Individuals are selected to reproduce, but it is the allele (a variant form of a gene at a specific gene locus) and trait frequencies within the population that evolve over time and generations.\n",
        "    * Genotype and Phenotype: Genetic makeup of an individual and its observable traits.\n",
        "    * Genotype-Phenotype Map (Ontogeny): How genotypes translate to phenotypes over an individual's lifespan.\n",
        "    * Genes and Alleles: Genes are the basic units of heredity that dictate traits through coded instructions. Alleles are the different variants of a gene, located at specific positions (loci) on a chromosome.\n",
        "  2. Unpack the Dynamics of Evolution:\n",
        "    * Reproduction and Fitness: Who gets to pass on how many of their alleles, how many copies they pass on, to whom, and why. This process is not random but is guided by environmental conditions that act as a filter on the traits of individuals.\n",
        "    * Selection: The natural process that filters individuals based on their fitness, essentially acting as an environmental sieve that determines which traits are favorable for reproduction.\n",
        "    * Heritable Variation: Genetic differences that can be passed down to the next generation.\n",
        "  3. Where Variation Comes from:  \n",
        "    * Mutation: Random changes in genetic material, that can produce wholly new genotypes.\n",
        "    * Recombination: The reshuffling of existing genes to create new genetic combinations.\n",
        "* Use a simple example throughout to show how these elements fit together in an evolutionary process.\n",
        "* Show how this evolutionary process is fundamentally a form of optimization, tuning a population for better survival and reproduction over time.\n"

        "We're going to explore the fundamentals of evolution using the following simple scenario. Drawing inspiration from the sand-striker worm (Eunice aphroditois), imagine an organism that lurks in its burrow, with just its chemosensory antennae sticking out. Whenever food that 'smells good' (as determined by its antennae receptors) passes by, the worm lunges from its lair to snatch the morsel, incapacitate it if need be, and drag it back home for a feast. Yum! We model this organism with a simplified 'genome'—an array of bits where each bit codes for the presence (1) or absence (0) of a distinct chemosensory receptor on the worm's antennae.\n",
        "\n",
        "The organism's life centers around one core problem: to 'strike' or 'not strike'. A successful strike at edible food yields a reward, $r$. While the immediate benefits of this come from fats, proteins, and calories, and the impact of these resources on survival and reproduction fluctuates based on the worm's condition, we simplify by saying each successful capture increases the number of viable gametes by $r$, thereby affecting the chances of the organisms offspring being in the next generation. Conversely, a missed strike costs $c$. While these immediate costs manifest as increased predation risk or lost opportunity, which may have complex impacts on survival and reproduction depending on the worm's condition, we again simplify this cost as a constant gamete decrement by $c$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The environment our organism finds itself in, in this first minimal example, consists of a series of encounters with several different kinds of food and non-food items. Each kind of item is tagged with distinct chemical markers, akin to different 'scents' or 'flavors'. Note that these markers will sometimes partially (but never totally) overlap between items regardless of food / non-food categorization, depending on the particular details of the environment, creating potential for misjudgment. Our organism's chemosensory antennae, coded by its genome, are sensitive to these markers. In each of these encounters, the organism faces its core 'strike' or 'not strike' problem, which it 'solves' with the following decision rule: the worm strikes only if all of its receptors pick up a marker and refrains from striking if any of its receptors are left unactivated, (Note that this means it will always strike if it has no receptors). In the simulation below see if you can find the optimal 'genome' for an organism.  To start you can see the 'markers' on the different food and non-food items."

        "So already in this very simple example some interesting things are happening. In our example, by construction, each location on the genome can be thought of as a 'gene' for a particular receptor with two possible alleles, presence or absense of the corresponding chemosenory receptor on an antenna. However, we might also zoom out our analysis and look at traits at the behavioural level, e.g. we say that 'Striking at Food Item 2' (with markers [1, 0, 1, 1]) is a trait, then we find that any of the genes for receptor 1, 3, or 4 might equally be considered a 'Gene for Striking at Food Item 2'. In a different environment, where the markers for food and non-food items are slightly different—for example, if 'Food Item 2' has markers [1, 0, 0, 0]—now only the gene for receptor 1 might be considered the 'Gene for Striking at Food Item 2'. This hints at the potential complexity of the mapping from gene to behaviour (through ontogeny and mechanisms) and also emphasizes its strong context-dependence, i.e. its sensitivity to the specifics of the environment."

When you were twiddling the genes in the exercise above, you had the benefit of know what the markers were for the food and non-food items, the costs and rewards of different outcomes, and the relative frequencies of food versus non-food items appearing. The evolutionary process is effectively blind to all of this, the problem that evolution faces is more like the following exercise."

        "One of the ways that evolution is able to search high-dimensional parameters spaces (big genomes) despite the curse of dimensionality is because it is massively parrellel. Many variants (possibly as many as there are individiuals in a population) are evaluated in parrellel within each generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a very [coarse first approximation](# \"This is a good first approximiation but completely fails to address many critical aspects of evoltuion, in particular the emergence of new genetic loci.\"), evolution can be thought of as allele frequency changes within a population. In this simplified framing evolution can be seen as the aggregate affects at the population level of selection acting on individuals. Populations evolve, individuals are selected. To see how evolution can solve this problem, even when the search space is large and opaque, we will simulate a population of organisms, apply the 'environmental seive' by having those individuals with the highest score in the 'strike' or 'no-strike' game be the ones most likely to have their offspring in the subsequent generation. In this first simplified simulation we will work with asexual haploid organisms. This is only to ease simulation and thinking about the model though. Note that sex--and other forms of gene transfer-- together with multiple chromosomes are the general rule in life. In the next sequences we will look at how sex (and re-combination enabled by diplody) radically amplifies the effectiveness of pure brute force parrellelism."

If there are twelve receptors instead of four then there are will be roughly four times as many possible genotype variants ($4096 = 2^{12}$) as there were individuals in this simulated population of 1000. The process above will select good variants from the existing population, but will never introduce new variants to the population, so if there are no good variants in the intial population, the process will not discover a good solution.

        "Because variant [0, 0, 1, 1] wasn't in our intitial population, the best initial variant [0, 0, 0, 1] was selected instead. What our evolutionary simulation is missing is a way of introducing variation into the population. We have selection, but selection can only ever reduce the number of distinct varients in the population, never introduce novel variants. This is where mutation comes in. Mutations (and recombination events in more complext replication processes) are necissary to create the heritable variation that is selected for in the first place. Though note that if mutation rates are too high variation become less heritable. So some mutation, but not too much is critical to an effective (in the sense of finding phenotypes that are well suited to the environment) evolutionary process. Let's add mutation to our evolutionary simulation and see if that helps in the case above where a small population does not start with a good solution."

Moreover, to allow for diverse policies to emerge, we're enhancing the prey's speed, allowing movement across two grid cells. This means the prey can target any of the 12 nearest cells, as opposed to just the 4 adjacent ones, effectively reaching any grid cell within its sight. Likewise, the predator's perceptive field is expanded, now encompassing 24 surrounding grid cells—effectively covering half the board when centered. Previously we didn't allow for organisms to stay in one spot, but now this will also be enabled for both prey and predator types. Below, we define a general class for these players (feel free to skim). Both the prey and predator organisms will be constructed from this foundational class using suitable parameters."

        "The predator organism, with its slower movement, can not directly chase down the faster prey. To successfully hunt, the predator must stay out of the prey's field of view, hoping that the prey will move within striking distance. Meanwhile, the prey organism faces its own challenges, constantly deciding between two conflicting approaches:\n",

        "Note that relative predation risks depend critically on the predator's policy. The resulting equilibrium from such an evolutionary tug-of-war is a set of policies where no single policy can unilaterally improve its outcome. In game theory, this stable state of the system—based on game payoffs—is termed a Nash Equilibrium. (In Game Theory the term \"strategies\" is typically used instead of policy, but we will continue to use \"policy\" in line with standard reinforcement learning terminology.)\n",

        "It's due to such nuances that we say evolution doesn't \"optimize\" in a traditional sense. Yet, while technically correct, a Nash Equilibrium is a set of policies that the \"best response\" to the each other. In this sense, evolutionary outcomes can be thought of as \"optimal.\"\n",

        "This concludes our exploration of how competition and interaction introduce complexities into optimization. While evolutionary processes are more than just optimization processes, as we progress in this book, we'll primarily sidestep these game-theoretic considerations. Our primary take-away is that because living organisms are embedded in such evolutionary systems, which inherently drive change, there are selective pressures not just for adaptation to changing environments but ***rapid*** adaptation. In the next sequence we will see how within lifetime learning can play an integral role in adapting to rapidly changing environments."
