        "### Objective: In the last sequence we explored the fundamentals of evolution using a simple 'strike' 'no-strike' (binary classification) problem 'solved' by the selective expression of chemosensory receptors. Our primary focus was on the parellels between evolutionary processes and optimzation. We hinted at the importance of mutation, population size, and strength of selection in determining whether or not a 'good' solution could even be found by our evolutionary process. In this sequence we are going to go a little deeper in our analysis and look not only at whether or not a 'good' solution can be found at all, but also at how quickly such a solution is found by an evolutionary process. We then show how sex (more specifically recombination) can radically accelerate this process. We end by introducing some of the arguments for the why evolution will select for mechanisms that accelerate adaptation by natural selection (i.e. why we would expect evolution to be self accelerating!)\n",

        "We will continue to use the 'strike' 'no-strike' decision problem of the last sequence, but within an environment specifically tailored to streamline our reasoning and analysis. Consider an organism with $n$ chemosensory receptors, each corresponding to $n$ possible food/non-food chemical markers in the environment. The expression of these receptors is determined by $n$ distinct genetic switches, represented as bitstring $g$ of length $n$ with 1 corresponding to expression and 0 to absence of a receptor. For the food source the marker consists of all 1's. The non-food items closely mimic this food signal, with each non-food item's marker differing from the food-item marker in exactly one marker/receptor slot. With $n$ receptors, this means we have $n$ distinct non-food item markers, each with distinct location for its solitary zero disrupting an otherwise unbroken set 1's.   \n",
        "\n",
        "Recall a successful strike at edible food yields a reward, $r$ and conversely, a missed strike has a cost, $c$. And we simplify these costs and rewards as constant gamete increment by $r$ or decrement by $c$ respectively. The organism's decision rule is to strike only if ***all*** of its receptors pick up a marker and refrains from striking if ***any*** of its receptors are left unactivated. (When the organism has no receptors technically all of its non-existent receptors are activated and so it strikes in all situations.)\n",
        "\n",
        "With this decision rule, in this environment, the organism will always strike at the food-item. Each additional receptor expressed  serves to sift out one specific type of non-food item, thereby reducing false positives. The singular 'optimal' genotype in this simple case consists of all 1's.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let $p$ be the probability of encountering a food item and $1-p$ the probability of an encounter with a non-food item. Given $k$ trials, an organism is expected to encounter $p k$ food items for a total expected gamete increment of $p k r$. It can also expect to encounter $(1-p)k$ non-food items, with each of $n$ distinct non-food item types being equally likely to be encountered. If a non-food item is encountered and the organism expresses the receptor that filters it out then the organism pays no cost, but if they do not express the filtering receptor particular to that specific non-food item they pay a cost of $c$. Then, the total expected fitness decrement from false strikes is  $k (1-p) \\frac{c}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1 - g_i)$. Thus the expression of each receptor, i.e. having allele '1' instead of '0' at any loci, confers a small, independent, additive fitness benefit $ k (1-p) \\frac{c}{n}$. In this sense our scenario is very similar to that analyzed in the to McKay book and in \"Beneficial Mutation-Selection Balance and the Effect of Linkage on Positive Selection\" by Desai & Fisher 2007.\n",

        "Before getting into any analyses lets observe how mutation rate, population size, and strength of selection impact two things, the final fitness level achieved by the population and the time it takes for the evolutionary process to discover the optimal genotype in this simplest of possible fitness landscapes."

        "Now obviously both $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ will changing over time until equilibrium is reached, but for large $n$ and small $m$ the rate of change for $\\sigma^2$ will be much smaller, so our approximation here should not be too bad. Note that the variance added by mutation is constant, while the variance reduced by selection is proportion to the existing variance, so population variation will settle into this equilibrium eventually, our approximation here is based on the idea that this balance is roughly maintained even as the mean of the distribution shifts upward due to selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also note that as the mean population value of $z$ increases, so too does the variance of $z$ (according to this model). This phenomenon arises because, although the mutation rate stays constant, the strength of selection diminishes as the mean of $z$ in the population increases. With lower strength of selection, the rate at which deleterious mutants are cleared from the population and the rate at which beneficial mutations grow and shift the population composition diminishes, and so greater variance is able to persist in the population. But why is the stength of selection decreasing as the mean value of $z$ increases? Although the absolute effect of each allele at each locus is constant, their relative impact diminishes as the the population mean of $z$ increases. This underscores another important point, ***fitness is always relative***. A function impacting fitness, like $z(g)$ in our example, might be absolute and depend solely on the traits/genes of a single individual. However, the way this score translates into frequency changes of genotypes or alleles at the population level — that is, fitness — is inherently dependent on the relative standing of those traits/genes within the population context. In other words, an individual's fitness can never be just a product of their own genes and traits, but must also depend on how those genes and corresponding traits compare to those of the rest of the population.\n",

        "If the expected number of bits flipped by mutation per genotype,\n",
        "$mn$, is greater than 1, then model predicts that the mean trait of the population will approaches an equilibrium value $\\mu^* \\simeq \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{mn}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}$. Note that when $mn < 1$ the model predicts equilibrium values greater than one which is outside of the allowable range of $\\mu$. This is because the model is somewhat inaccurate in that the true probability distribution of $z$ is non-Gaussian, asymmetrical, and quantized to integer values. This approximation works relatively well, (in terms of alignment with simulations), when the equilibrium value predicted is far enough from the upper bound on $z$ that the normal approximation is not postulating postitive variation above the mean that simply would not be present if the true distribution (which would be truncated at 1) were being used. To improve the model in these cases we would need to use the appropriate truncated normal distribution. But the model does make the prediction that for $mn > 1$ the mutation rate is so high, that the population will never attain the optimal \"all 1's\" genotype; the relative selective advantage of any given locus having the 1 allele instead of the 0 allele is too small compared to the rate at which mutation introduces new (typically less fit) types, and population's genotype cannot 'improve' past a certain point."

In evolutionary models the function often refered to as the 'fitness' function does not directly give fitness in the sense of growth rate (as defined above), but rather some score upon which selection and reproduction is based. The specific population dynamics are what translate the 'fitness score' function into 'fitness growth rate' function. Throughout we will use fitness $w$ to denote growth rate fitness, and more standard $f(g)$ to denote a fitness score function. Note that while $f(g)$ may not be game theoretic, i.e. may only depend on that genotype, and not on the relative frequencies of other genotypes in the population, **fitness is the sense of relative growth, $w_g$, will always depend on the relative frequencies of the various other types in the population.**"

        "So already in this very simple example some interesting things are happening. In our example, by construction, each location on the genome represents a 'gene' for a specific receptor with two possible alleles: the presence or absence of the corresponding chemosensory receptor on an antenna. However, we might also zoom out our analysis and look at traits at the behavioural level. For example, if we say that 'Striking at Food Item 2' (with markers '1011') is a trait, then we find that any of the genes for receptor 1, 3, or 4 might equally be considered a 'Gene for Striking at Food Item 2'. In a different environment, where the markers for food and non-food items vary—for instance, if 'Food Item 2' had markers '1000 instead—then only the gene for receptor 1 might be considered the 'Gene for Striking at Food Item 2'. This hints at the potential complexity of the mapping from gene to behaviour (through ontogeny and mechanisms) and also emphasizes the strong context-dependence of this mapping, i.e. its sensitivity to the specifics of the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite this complexity, as we'll soon see, the evolutionary process still manages to shape and select for complex traits. When you were twiddling the genes in the exercise above, you had the benefit of knowing what the markers were for the food and non-food items, the costs and rewards of different outcomes, the relative frequencies of food versus non-food items appearing, and the feedback about true and false negatives and positives. The evolutionary process is effectively blind to all of this. The problem that evolution faces is more like the following exercise, where the only feedback is a 'fitness score,' with no awareness of how that score came about. (Note that the individual organism may be aware of the differences between true and false positives, and maybe even between true and false negatives, but the evolutionary process itself is not.)"

        "One of the ways that evolution is able to search high-dimensional parameters spaces (big genomes) despite the curse of dimensionality is because it operates in a massively parallel manner. Many variants are evaluated in parallel within each generation, potentially as many as there are individuals in a population.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a very [coarse first approximation](# \"This is a good first approximation but completely fails to address many critical aspects of evolution, in particular the emergence of new genetic loci.\"), evolution can be thought of as changes in allele frequencies within a population. In this simplified framing evolution can be seen as the aggregate effects at the population level of selection acting on individuals. Populations evolve; individuals are selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "To see how evolution can search a large and opaque genotype space for a good solution to this 'strike' or 'no strike' problem, we will simulate evolution in a population of organisms. We'll apply the 'environmental seive' by having those individuals with the highest score in the 'strike' or 'no-strike' game be the ones most likely to have their offspring in the subsequent generation. In this first simplified simulation, we will work with asexual haploid organisms. Note that sex—and other forms of gene transfer—along with multiple chromosomes are the general rule in life. In the next sequences, we will explore how sex (and recombination enabled by diploidy) can radically amplify the effectiveness of evolution's pure brute-force parallelism."

        "Mutation effectively introduced variation, allowing the parameter space to be searched more thoroughly. The mean population fitness stabilized around 42.7 after this simulation, compared to approximately 22.4 in the previous simulation without mutation. But can we do better? Unfortunately, we can't assume that just because this is the output of an evolutionary process, we have reached some kind of globally optimal solution. (Although in this case by inspecting the problem we can conclude that our evolutionary process with mutation did indeed find the best solution in this instance). One important reason for this is because evolution is effectively a hill climbing algorithm. Mutations make small steps in the genotype/parameter space, and if these mutations prove beneficial (which they often don't), they are more likely to be retained in subsequent generations (this is selection). These beneficial mutations then become the basis for further exploration of the parameters space through additional mutations. But there is always the possibility that there is some really great solution that was not reachable by an 'adaptive path' of mutations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a scenario where two peaks represent local optima in the fitness landscape. These peaks are separated by a 'maladaptive valley,' a region of lower fitness. An evolving population that starts near one of these peaks would likely climb toward that local optimum due to natural selection favoring incremental improvements. However, reaching the higher peak on the other side of the valley would require a sequence of mutations that initially decrease fitness before eventually leading to a much higher fitness level. In such cases, natural selection would typically weed out these 'stepping-stone' mutations before they could lead to the higher peak, causing the population to get stuck at the lower local optimum. We can see just such an example of this scenario play out the simulation below."

        "In this example, the population starts out completely dominated by the all receptors '111' (aka variant 7). None of the food items ('001', '010', '100') trigger a strike for this variant, nor do any of the non-food items ('011', '101', '110'). As a result, this variant never strikes and neither gains nor loses fitness from the strike/no-strike aspect of their life. Occasionally, mutation introduces a new variant, but over the course of the thousand generations in the simulation, all of these are 1-bit mutants. While these mutants still don't strike at any of the food items, they do strike at one of the non-food items, incurring a cost of $c$ in one-sixth (half of the scenarios are non-food items and one-third of those are the specific non-food item that a particular mutant will strike). Because these mutants have lower fitness than the dominant type they are swiftly removed from the population by selection.\n",

Given that food and non-food items are equally likely to be encountered, striking at everything results in positive expected fitness increment. This makes it a better strategy than striking at nothing, which has an expected reward of zero. However, in the simulation above, our process couldn't reach this superior solution. This is because these local optima in the fitness landscape were separated by a so-called 'fitness valley,' and there was no 'adaptive path' bridging them."

        "With this higher mutation rate we observe that even though the optimal variant is identified, the high mutation rate results in a decrease in overall population fitness. In this simulation The mean population fitness is approximately 35.9, significantly lower than the expected fitness score of 50 for the best variant. This hints at a fundamental trade-off between exploration (seeking new solutions) and exploitation (utilizing current best solutions). Low mutation rates can trap the evolutionary process in suboptimal local fitness peaks, hindering the discovery of superior solutions. However, a high mutation rate reduces overall fitness, since mutations typically deviate from an already effective genotype. With this in mind, let's look a little more formally at how evolution can (and can't) be thought of as fitness optimization process."

        "Because of selection, the population's dominant genotype is more likely to shift toward regions of higher fitness. Over time, this leads to populations typically being found in these high fitness regions, which explains the highly adapted traits observed in nature. In this sense both real-world evolutionary processes and the simulated versions we've explored can be thought of optimization algorithms finding good parameters for a fitness function. But there are some key differences. One such key difference is that evolution has no termination condition. Evolution doesn't stop when a 'good enough' or 'best' solution is reached because the process is blind to the overall structure of the problem being solved. So, even after stumbling upon a 'good' solution, mutations continue, and they mostly end up being counterproductive. When a complicated and efficient system is working well, most changes will make things worse!\n",

        "The answer lies in the dynamic properties of evolutionary processes. With enough selection pressure, evolution exhibits 'sticky attractors' within the landscape of genetic possibilities. These are states that, once attained, tend to be stable over long periods, even amidst ongoing mutations. The 'stickiness' of these attractors means that, despite continuous evolution, populations tend to remain within these high-fitness states."

We will address changing fitness functions and fitness function that depend on the genotype of other individuals later in this chapter.\n",

More complex events have an effectively negligible probability of occurring. Being able to effectively ignore complex mutation events is what the 'rare mutation' assumption is about. The time between appearances of mutant variants will follow a Poisson distribution with new mutant variants being introduced every 2501 generations on average.

        "In the theory of Markov processes an absorbing state is one that, once entered, cannot be left. Because of our assumption of strong selection our Markov process has such absorbing states and these correspond precisely to local maxima of the fitness function $f$. This simplifies our understanding of the long-term behavior of the evolutionary process. Specifically, over an infinitely long time horizon, the population will almost surely end up in one of these local optima and remain there. In other words, the absorbing states serve as 'sinks' that capture the evolutionary trajectory. This helps to explain why even though evolution is an ongoing process and blind to the underlying structure of the fitness function, it nevertheless often settles in at local optima of the fitness function. It is in this sense that the evolutionary process can be viewed as an optimization algorithm, and one that is guaranteed (under certain conditions, using the theory of Markov processes) to converge on local fitness maxima. Note though there are not guarantees about how these local fitness maxima related to the global maxima. This is because evolution is essentially a local 'hill-climbing' process with no awareness of the global shape of the fitness landscape. Its only awareness is of the smear of points in the genotype space that the population is currently able to sample, i.e. those points close enough to the dominant variant(s) given the mutation process.\n",

        "In this argument that links absorbing states to local fitness optima—hinging on our assumption that $\\phi(g,g') \\approx 0$ when $f(g) > f(g')$ and $\\phi(g, g') > 0$ when $f(g) \\leq f(g')$—we are not able to say much about which optima the evolutionary process will end up in. In the appendix we present a more nuanced version of this argument. It uses a weaker assumption where less fit mutants do have a small, but non-negligible probability of becoming dominant, i.e. $0 < \\phi(g,g') < \\epsilon$ when $f(g) > f(g')$ and $\\phi(g, g') \\geq \\epsilon$ when $f(g) \\leq f(g')$. This allows for exploration of how the details of the genotype space (and in particular the geometry of that space induced by the mutation process) together with the fitness function determine which states an evolutionary process is likely to spend most of its time in.  \n"
