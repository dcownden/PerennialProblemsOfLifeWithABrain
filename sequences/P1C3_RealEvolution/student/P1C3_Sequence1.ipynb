    "The following is part of a test for an upcoming text book on computational neuroscience from an optimization and learning perspective. The book will start with evolution because ultimately, all aspects of the brain are shaped by evolution and, as we will see, evolution can also be seen as an optimization algorithm. We are sharing it now to get feedback on what works and what does not and the developments we should do."

    "# **1.3.1: Populations and Inheritance**\n",
    "### Objective: We concluded the last chapter by discussing how neuroscience has traditionally focused on neural mechanisms of behaviour. While neural ontogeny has also been a focus of neuroscience, we argued that even greater focus on ontogeny could benefit both brain and behavioural sciences. Evolutionary thinking underpins this argument, and frames the brain as an evolved tool for rapid adaptation. To fully grasp this perspective, we first need to understand the core principles of evolutionary theory. Our aim here is to set out and explore these core principles of evolution through simple examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sequence we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Outline the fundamental concepts of evolution and natural selection:\n",
    "  1. Key Players in Evolution:\n",
    "    * Populations and Individuals: The collective and singular units of evolution. Individuals are selected to reproduce, but it is the allele (a variant form of a gene at a specific gene locus) and trait frequencies within the population that evolve over time and generations.\n",
    "    * Genotype and Phenotype: Genetic makeup of an individual and its observable traits (including behavioural traits).\n",
    "    * Genotype-Phenotype Map (Ontogeny): How genotypes translate to phenotypes over an individual's lifespan.\n",
    "    * Genes and Alleles: Genes are the basic units of heredity that dictate traits through coded instructions. Alleles are the different variants of a gene, located at specific positions (loci) on a chromosome.\n",
    "  2. Dynamics of Evolution:\n",
    "    * Reproduction and Fitness: Who gets to pass their alleles, how many copies they pass on, to whom, and why. This process is guided by environmental conditions that act as a filter on the traits of individuals.\n",
    "    * Selection: The natural process that filters individuals based on their fitness, essentially acting as an environmental sieve that determines which traits are favorable for reproduction.\n",
    "    * Heritable Variation: Phenotypic differences between individuals that are underpinned (at least in part) by genetic differences and so can be passed down to the next generation.\n",
    "  3. Sources of Variation Driving Evolution:  \n",
    "    * Mutation: Random changes in genetic material that can produce wholly new genotypes.\n",
    "    * Recombination: The reshuffling of existing genes to create new genetic combinations.\n",
    "* Use a simple example to show how these elements fit together in an evolutionary process.\n",
    "* Show how this evolutionary process is fundamentally a form of optimization, tuning a population for better survival and reproduction over time.\n"

    "# 1.3.1.1: A Bite-Sized Evolution Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to explore the fundamentals of evolution using the following simple scenario. Drawing inspiration from the sand-striker worm (Eunice aphroditois), imagine an organism that lurks in its burrow, with just its chemosensory antennae sticking out. Whenever food that 'smells good' (as determined by its antennae receptors) passes by, the worm lunges from its lair to snatch the morsel, incapacitate it if need be, and drag it back home for a feast. Yum! We model this organism with a simplified 'genome'â€”an array of bits where each bit codes for the presence (1) or absence (0) of a distinct chemosensory receptor on the worm's antennae.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organism's life centers around one core problem: to 'strike' or 'not strike'. A successful strike at edible food yields a reward, $r$. While the immediate benefits of this come from fats, proteins, and calories, and the impact of these resources on survival and reproduction fluctuates based on the worm's condition, we simplify by saying each successful capture increases the number of viable gametes by $r$, thereby affecting the chances of the organism's offspring being in the next generation. Conversely, a missed strike has a cost, $c$. While these immediate costs manifest as increased predation risk or lost opportunity, which may have complex impacts on survival and reproduction depending on the worm's condition, we again simplify this cost as a constant gamete decrement by $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment our organism finds itself in, in this first minimal example, consists of a series of encounters with several different kinds of food and non-food items. Each kind of item is tagged with distinct chemical markers, akin to different 'scents' or 'flavours'. Note that these markers will sometimes partially (but never totally) overlap between items regardless of food / non-food categorization, depending on the particular details of the environment. This creates potential for misjudgment. Our organism's chemosensory antennae, coded by its genome, are sensitive to these markers. In each of these encounters, the organism faces its core 'strike' or 'not strike' problem, which it 'solves' with the following decision rule: the worm strikes only if ***all*** of its receptors pick up a marker and refrains from striking if ***any*** of its receptors are left unactivated. (When the organism has no receptors technically all of its non-existent receptors are activated and so it strikes in all situations.) This is a very simple decision rule, and certainly not the best one in terms of making use of the sensory receptors available, but it for illustrative purposes it is the one we will work with. In the simulation below see if you can find the optimal 'genome' for an organism. To get started, you can observe the 'markers' on the different food and non-food items."

    "So already in this very simple example some interesting things are happening. In our example, by construction, each location on the genome represents a 'gene' for a specific receptor with two possible alleles: the presence or absence of the corresponding chemosensory receptor on an antenna. However, we might also zoom out our analysis and look at traits at the behavioural level. For example, if we say that 'Striking at Food Item 2' (with markers '1011') is a trait, then we find that any of the genes for receptor 1, 3, or 4 might equally be considered a 'Gene for Striking at Food Item 2'. In a different environment, where the markers for food and non-food items varyâ€”for instance, if 'Food Item 2' had markers '1000 insteadâ€”then only the gene for receptor 1 might be considered the 'Gene for Striking at Food Item 2'. This hints at the potential complexity of the mapping from gene to behaviour (through ontogeny and mechanisms) and also emphasizes the strong context-dependence of this mapping, i.e. its sensitivity to the specifics of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this complexity, as we'll soon see, the evolutionary process still manages to shape and select for complex traits. When you were twiddling the genes in the exercise above, you had the benefit of knowing what the markers were for the food and non-food items, the costs and rewards of different outcomes, the relative frequencies of food versus non-food items appearing, and the feedback about true and false negatives and positives. The evolutionary process is effectively blind to all of this. The problem that evolution faces is more like the following exercise, where the only feedback is a 'fitness score,' with no awareness of how that score came about. (Note that the individual organism may be aware of the differences between true and false positives, and maybe even between true and false negatives, but the evolutionary process itself is not.)"

In this first simplified simulation, we will work with asexual haploid organisms. Note that sexâ€”and other forms of gene transferâ€”along with multiple chromosomes are the general rule in life.

    "Mutation effectively introduced variation, allowing the parameter space to be searched more thoroughly. The mean population fitness stabilized around 42.7 after this simulation, compared to approximately 22.4 in the previous simulation without mutation. But can we do better? Unfortunately, we can't assume that just because this is the output of an evolutionary process, we have reached some kind of globally optimal solution. (Although in this case by inspecting the problem we can conclude that our evolutionary process with mutation did indeed find the best solution in this instance). One important reason for this is because evolution is effectively a hill climbing algorithm. Mutations make small steps in the genotype-parameter space, and if these mutations prove beneficial (which they often don't), they are more likely to be retained in subsequent generations (this is selection). These beneficial mutations then become the basis for further exploration of the genotype-parameter space through additional mutations. But, there is always the possibility that there is some really great solution that was not reachable by an 'adaptive path' of mutations.\n",

    "## Simulation: Selection Caught in a Local Optimum\n",
    "Consider a scenario where two peaks represent local optima in the fitness landscape. These peaks are separated by a 'maladaptive valley,' a region of lower fitness. An evolving population that starts near one of these peaks would likely climb toward that local optimum due to natural selection favoring incremental improvements. However, reaching the higher peak on the other side of the valley would require a sequence of mutations that initially decrease fitness before eventually leading to a much higher fitness level. In such cases, natural selection would typically weed out these 'stepping-stone' mutations before they could lead to the higher peak, causing the population to get stuck at the lower local optimum. We can see just such an example of this scenario play out the simulation below."

None of the food items ('001', '010', '100') trigger a strike for this variant, nor do any of the non-food items ('011', '101', '110'). As a result, this variant never strikes and neither gains nor loses fitness from the strike/no-strike aspect of their life, they get a score of zero. Occasionally, mutation introduces a new variant, but over the course of the thousand generations in the simulation, all of these are 1-bit mutants. While these mutants still don't strike at any of the food items, they do strike at one of the non-food items, incurring a cost of $c$ in one-sixth (half of the scenarios are non-food items and one-third of those are the specific non-food item that a particular mutant will strike).

This makes it a better strategy than striking at nothing, which has an expected reward of zero. However, in the simulation above, our process couldn't reach this superior solution.

    "With this higher mutation rate we observe that even though the optimal variant is identified, the high mutation rate results in a decrease in overall population fitness. In this simulation the mean population fitness is approximately 35.9, significantly lower than the expected fitness score of 50 for the best variant. This hints at a fundamental trade-off between exploration (seeking new solutions) and exploitation (utilizing current best solutions). Low mutation rates can trap the evolutionary process in suboptimal local fitness peaks, hindering the discovery of superior solutions. However, a high mutation rate reduces overall fitness, since mutations typically deviate from an already effective genotype. With this in mind, let's look a little more formally at how evolution can (and can't) be thought of as fitness optimization process."

    "Because of selection, the population's dominant genotype is more likely to shift toward regions of higher fitness. Over time, this leads to populations typically being found in these high fitness regions, which explains the highly adapted traits observed in nature. In this sense both real-world evolutionary processes and the simulated versions we've explored can be thought of optimization algorithms finding good parameters for a fitness function. But there are some key differences. One such key difference is that evolution has no termination condition. Evolution doesn't stop when a 'good enough' or 'best' solution is reached because the process is blind to the overall structure of the problem being solved. So, even after stumbling upon a 'good' solution, mutations continue, and they mostly end up being counterproductive. When a complicated and efficient system is working well, most changes will make things worse!\n",

    "\n",
    "The answer lies in the dynamic properties of evolutionary processes. With enough selection pressure, evolution exhibits 'sticky attractors' within the landscape of genetic possibilities. These are states that, once attained, tend to be stable over long periods, even amidst ongoing mutations. The 'stickiness' of these attractors means that, despite continuous evolution, populations tend to remain within these high-fitness states."

There's a fitness function $f(g): G \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that maps each genotype $g$ in $G$ to a real number representing its fitness. For the sake of simplicity, we'll assume that fitness depends solely on an individual's genotype, not on the genotypes of others in the population, or the genotypes present in other evolving population, and that this function (which represents the environment) remains constant throughout the process. We will address changing fitness functions and fitness function that depend on the genotype of other individuals later in this chapter.\n",

The time between appearances of mutant variants will follow a Poisson distribution with new mutant variants being introduced every 2501 generations on average for these example parameters.

    "In the theory of Markov processes an absorbing state is one that, once entered, cannot be left. Because of our assumption of strong selection our Markov process has such absorbing states and these correspond precisely to local maxima of the fitness function $f$. This simplifies our understanding of the long-term behavior of the evolutionary process. Specifically, over an infinitely long time horizon, the population will almost surely end up in one of these local optima and remain there. In other words, the absorbing states serve as 'sinks' that capture the evolutionary trajectory. This helps to explain why even though evolution is an ongoing process and blind to the underlying structure of the fitness function, it nevertheless often settles in at local optima of the fitness function. It is in this sense that the evolutionary process can be viewed as an optimization algorithm, and one that is guaranteed (under certain conditions, using the theory of Markov processes) to converge on local fitness maxima. Note though there are no guarantees about how these local fitness maxima related to the global maxima. This is because evolution is essentially a local 'hill-climbing' process with no awareness of the global shape of the fitness landscape. Its only awareness is of the smear of points in the genotype space that the population is currently able to sample, i.e. those points close enough to the dominant variant(s) given the mutation process.\n",

In the appendix we present a more nuanced version of this argument. It uses a weaker assumption where less fit mutants do have a small, but non-negligible probability of becoming dominant, i.e. $0 < \\phi(g,g') < \\epsilon$ when $f(g) > f(g')$ and $\\phi(g, g') \\geq \\epsilon$ when $f(g) \\leq f(g')$.

    "3. Explore the importance of within lifetime learning, both as a response to rapid environmental change within an individual's lifetime, but also as an accelerator of the evolutionary process."
