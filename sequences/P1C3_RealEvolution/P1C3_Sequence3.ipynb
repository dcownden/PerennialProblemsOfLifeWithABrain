One organism's policy is another organism's environment! In this sequence you will:\n",

        "# 1.2.3.1: Eat and Be Eaten\n",
        "\n",
        "Previously, in sequence 1.1.3, we touched upon how competition (or interactions) with other organisms can play a crucial role in the environment an organism adapts its behavior to, Now that we have a richer optimization and evolutionary framework we're going to dig into how these kinds of interactions really exacerbate the optimization problem. We'll modify Gridworld (again!) this time introducing two different types of organism. The first is a prey organism that eats (stationary) food much as in our original Gridworld variant. The second is predator organism that eats the prey organism (by moving onto a grid cell containing a prey organism). Much like food, a new prey organism re-spawns randomly in an empty grid cell when eaten. Now, we have two distinct games being played: the 'Eat Food, Don't Get Eaten' game for the prey and the 'Eat the Prey' game for the predator. These are of course different perspectives on the same interaction, but as we will see, it will help our analysis to separate out these two points of view. First though to get a feel for things, play the game first as a predator organism, then as prey organism. And see how it goes. In this first instance the prey organism just moves uniformly at random to a valid destination. To create an interesting playing field, the prey can now move up to 2 grid cells at once or stay stationary. The predator has an expanded perceptive field, but it can move only one grid cell (or none) at a time."

Moreover, to allow for diverse policies to emerge, we're enhancing the prey's speed, allowing movement across two grid cells. This means the prey can target any of the 12 nearest cells, as opposed to just the 4 adjacent ones, effectively reaching any grid cell within its sight. Likewise, the predator's perceptive field is expanded, now encompassing 24 surrounding grid cells—effectively covering half the board when centered. Previously we didn't allow for organisms to stay in one spot, but now this will also be enabled for both prey and predator types. Below, we define a general class for these players (feel free to skim). Both the prey and predator organisms will be constructed from this foundational class using suitable parameters."

For optimization, we'll use an enhanced version of the evolutionary algorithm from sequence 1.3.1, known as the Covariance Matrix Adapted Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES). While CMA-ES primarily mirrors our basic evolutionary algorithm its distinction lies in its 'mutation' distribution. Guided by an evolving covariance matrix, this distribution changes over time, leading to mutants with an increased likelihood of fitness improvement. This changing 'mutation' distribution can be seen as a kind of meta-evolution, where mutability itself evolves."

        "The predator organism, with its slower movement, can not directly chase down the faster prey. To successfully hunt, the predator must stay out of the prey's field of view, hoping that the prey will move within striking distance. Meanwhile, the prey organism faces its own challenges, constantly deciding between two conflicting approaches:\n",

        "Note that relative predation risks depend critically on the predator's policy. The resulting equilibrium from such an evolutionary tug-of-war is a set of policies where no single policy can unilaterally improve its outcome. In game theory, this stable state of the system—based on game payoffs—is termed a Nash Equilibrium. (In Game Theory the term \"strategies\" is typically used instead of policy, but we will continue to use \"policy\" in line with standard reinforcement learning terminology.)\n",

        "3. The set of policies optimizing the average payoff across both populations.\n",

        "It's due to such nuances that we say evolution doesn't \"optimize\" in a traditional sense. Yet, while technically correct, a Nash Equilibrium is a set of policies that the \"best response\" to the each other. In this sense, evolutionary outcomes can be thought of as \"optimal.\"\n",

        "In Sequence 1.2.3, we explored the idea that optima depict an ideal state. The concept of equilibria, as illustrated here, extends and refines this notion.

        "This concludes our exploration of how competition and interaction introduce complexities into optimization. While evolutionary processes are more than just optimization processes, as we progress in this book, we'll primarily sidestep these game-theoretic considerations. Our primary take-away is that because living organisms are embedded in such evolutionary systems, which inherently drive change, there are selective pressures not just for adaptation to changing environments but ***rapid*** adaptation. In the next sequence we will see how within lifetime learning can play an integral role in adapting to rapidly changing environments."
