Due to the stochastic spiking of neurons, in any given episode of senosry input -> behaviour production -> contingent reward, some but not all of the synaptic weights are causally implicated in the production of the behaviour (and consequent reward). When a good thing happens, synaptic connections that were involved in the generation of the behaviour should be strengthened, and conversely when bad things happen synaptic connections that were involved in the generation of the behaviour should be weakened. Synaptic connections that were not involved in producing the behaviour should be left unchanged. Zooming in to the synaptic level the four cases above are expanded as follows:\n",

So our rule needs to prescribe no change, unless both pre- and post- synaptic neurons have fired. If a good thing happens, then the connection should be reinforced, and if a bad thing happens then the connection should be weakened. Our learning rule written to echo and presiage the 'REINFORCE' formulation of Williams (1992), and also Resrola Wagnar rule, and also TD formulations. In some sense this is cannonical form of learning rules is.\n",

        "Almost every learning rule for parameters that we look at will be roughly composed of these three factors: learning rate, error, eligibility. The first factor is positive learning rate or step size parameter of the learning process. In this specific case $\\alpha$ is constant, but it could be made contingent on various factors in more complicated models, e.g. learning rates often start high and are lowered as the learning system gets more 'dialed in'. The second part is an 'error' term, in this case a 'reward prediction error', $(r-b)$, gives the way in which the actual received reward $r$ differs from some baseline expectation. Again in more complicated learning rules $b$ could be made contingent on many factors, and this contingency of $b$ on other factors might itself be learned. Here though, we assume a constant expected reward, $b=0$, so we can think of $b$ as an expectation of how good the world is on average, if the organism is performing as well as expected. We imagine that parameters like $\\alpha$ and $b$ are set and tuned by evolution to ensure effective learning. Lastly, in this simple model the $s_i \\cdot s_o$ term is the 'eligibility' of the synapse for change. In general, this will be some measure of how causally implicated the particular parameter $w_i$ is in causing the received reward. Here we use one of the simplest possible eligibility terms, which takes the value one only when both pre- and post- synaptic neurons fire, and is otherwise zero. Again in more complicated learning rules, this eligibility term could be more complicated, e.g. it might incorporate knowledge of the structure of the network producing the behaviour, often in the form of a gradient, to further modulate the strength and direction of the weight change. Note, $w_i$ is the $i^{\\text{th}}$ element of $\\mathbf{W}$ and $s_i$ and $s_o$ are the realized spikes during the episode for the $i^{\\text{th}}$ input neuron and the output neuron respectively. Okay, let's implement and see how well this works!"
