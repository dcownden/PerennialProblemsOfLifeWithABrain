In this sequence we will expand on this theme, within the context evolution by considering a major source of 'environmental' variation: the evolution of other organisms. One organism's policy is another organism's environment! In this sequence we will:\n",

        "\n",
        "Previously, in sequences 1.1.3 and 1.2.2, we touched upon how competition (or interactions) with other organisms can play a crucial role in the environment an organism adapts its behavior to. Now that we have a richer optimization and evolutionary framework we're going to dig into how these kinds of interactions really exacerbate optimization or evelutionary search. We are going to stick with our simple strike-no-strike scenario from sequences 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, but modify it in a few significant ways. Previously our population of lurk-and-strike predators were the only thing evolving, however, now we are going to consider not just the lurk-and-strik predators, but also their prey population. Instead of treating the markers of the food items as an environmental given, we are going to let these markers emerge from the (highly abstracted) evolutionary process of the prey population. Now, we have two distinct populations facing two distinct problems: the predators with their strike-no-strike game, and the prey item tyring to remain undetectable."

        "We will continue to use the 'strike-no-strike' decision problem of the last two sequences, again with a specific environment tailored to streamline our simulations and reasoning. Our prey organism will have $2n$ chemosensory receptors, each corresponding to $2n$ possible food/non-food chemical markers in the environment. The expression of these receptors is determined by $2n$ distinct genetic switches, represented as a bit-string $g$ of length $n$ with 1 corresponding to expression and 0 to absence of the corresponding receptor.\n",
        "\n",
        "The big difference from before is that now the population of the prey species (food items) is also evolving. We asssume there are some constraints on what is possible, i.e. if the food item had no markers, it would be undetectable and never eaten, however. So for the sake of simplicity and an interesting model we assume that the prey species is contrained to express exactly $n$, that is half, of the $2n$ possible markers. To operationalize this in a more tractable way, we further assume that each of the $n$ markers expressed by the prey species comes in one of two possible (and mutually exclusive) flavours, e.g. for marker 1, the prey expresses either variant $a$ of $b$ for marker 2, the prey expresses either variant $c$ or $d$ and so on. This means that there will be $2^n$ distinct patterns of markers possible for the prey species. The marker expression pattern for the prey species will be determined by $n$ genetic switches, specifying which of two possible variants is expressed for each of $n$ different marker types.\n",
        "\n",
        "As in the previous sequence the non-food items will closely mimic possible food items. Specifically, evey non-food item will have a marker pattern which is identical to that of a food item, but with one $n$ possible marker types not expressed. Thus there will be $n \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ distinct such non-food item marker patterns, each represented as bitstrings consisting of $n+1$ zeros and $n-1$ ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall a successful strike at edible food yields a reward, $r$ and conversely, a missed strike has a cost, $c$. Not striking (both true and false negative) yield zero cost or reward. We think of these costs and rewards as a constant increment by $r$ or decrement by $c$ respectively to offspring quality and/or quantity. The organism's decision rule is to strike only if ***all*** of its receptors pick up a marker and refrains from striking if ***any*** of its receptors are left unactivated. (When the organism has no receptors technically all of its non-existent receptors are activated and so it strikes in all situations.)\n",
        "\n",
        "With this decision rule, in this environment, the organism will only strike at a its prey if all of its receptor are activated by that prey sepecies. Thus expressing a receptor which is not matched to a corresponding marker on the prey will result in missed opportunities to eat. Conversely, expressing receptors that are present on a prey species will supress false positive strikes and save the predator from the cost of false postive strikes. Already the fitness score function for the predator is much more complex, as it will depend on the frequencies of the various prey types in the prey population, which will themsleves be the result of an ongoing evoltionary process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let $p$ be the probability of encountering a food item and $1-p$ be the probability of an encounter with a non-food item. Given $k$ trials, an organism is expected to encounter $p k$ food items. However, each of these food items will express a different set of markers, according to the current (genetic) composition of the prey population. We let $h\\in\\mathcal{H}$ denote a specfic pattern of markers for a food item, within the set $\\mathcal{H}$ of $2^n$ possible marker configurations for the prey species. (0 denotes absence of a marker, 1 presence). Then we let $\\rho(h)$ denote the frequency of the $h$ type in the prey population, and we assume that probability of encounter for predators is equal to the frequency (abundance) of this type in the prey population. Then the expected reward from successful eating for a predator is\n",

        "\n",
        "This needs a little bit of unpacking. There are $pk$ exected encounters with food items. The probability of encountering any particular type $h$ is given by $\\rho(h)$. In general $\\rho(\\cdot)$ is used to represent the density function of the argument variable. Recall that $\\mathrm{I}_{\\{g_i = g_i h_i\\}}$ is an indicator function which takes a value of $1$ when the condition in the subscript, in this case $g_i = g_ih_i$ is true, and a value of $0$ when the condition in the subscript is false. Thus the product of these indicators is $1$ only if for every marker type where the predator expresses a receptor has a corresponding marker on the food item. The product of these indicators will be zero if any of the predator's receptors does not have a corresponding marker on the food-item. Note that markers on the food item that do not have corresponding receptors expressed by the predator have no bearing, i.e. $g_i = g_i h_i$ regardless of the value of $h_i$ when $g_i = 0$, only when $g_i =1$ is the value of $h_i$ relevant.\n",

Moreover, to allow for diverse policies to emerge, we're enhancing the prey's speed, allowing movement across two grid cells. This means the prey can target any of the 12 nearest cells, as opposed to just the 4 adjacent ones, effectively reaching any grid cell within its sight. Likewise, the predator's perceptive field is expanded, now encompassing 24 surrounding grid cells—effectively covering half the board when centered. Previously we didn't allow for organisms to stay in one spot, but now this will also be enabled for both prey and predator types. Below, we define a general class for these players (feel free to skim). Both the prey and predator organisms will be constructed from this foundational class using suitable parameters."

While CMA-ES primarily mirrors our basic evolutionary algorithm its distinction lies in its 'mutation' distribution. Guided by an evolving covariance matrix, this distribution changes over time, leading to mutants with an increased likelihood of fitness improvement. This changing 'mutation' distribution can be seen as a kind of meta-evolution, where mutability itself evolves."

While evolutionary processes are more than just optimization processes, as we progress in this book, we'll primarily sidestep these game-theoretic considerations. Our primary take-away is that because living organisms are embedded in such evolutionary systems, which inherently drive change, there are selective pressures not just for adaptation to changing environments but ***rapid*** adaptation.
