        "In the first part of the book we gained insight into what the brain is for: rapid acquisition of adaptive behaviours. Now that we know what a brain is for, we are going to start thinking about how it does what it needs to do. Instead of taking a bottom up approach grounded in observed physiological mechanisms, we are going to use a problem oriented, top down approach. That is, we will think about what problems the brain is solving and then survey the various physiological mechanisms that could feasibly implement algorithms that solve those problems. We will start with problems that are simple to understand from a statistical and mathematical perspective; a broad sub-field of machine learning known as supervised learning. Supervised learning problems take as given many affordances and abilities without obvious physiological implementations in the brain. Nevertheless, for simplicity and to build foundational understanding, we start with this class of problems and associated algorithms, drawing connections to physiological mechanisms where we can. As more elaborate learning algorithms (un/semi-supervised learning, complex reinforcement learning) and their applications become clear, we promise that an outline of the physiology of a unified neural system which feasibly solves the myriad statistical decision problems faced by living animals will emerge.\n",

        "In our last chapter, 1.4 Life is Reinforcment Learning, we motivated the idea that within life time learning of an organism can be understood as solving a particular set of reinforcment learning problems selected for by the evolutionary process. In particular we view the evolutionary process as selecting both the intrinsic reward signals (i.e. which kinds of base sensory inputs are are intrisicially rewarding) and the neural plasticity rules by which the sensory to behaviour function is updated using these reward signals. That is evolution selects for both the goals and the method of learning, chosing sensory grounded goals that guide behaviour towards being adaptive in the evolutionary sense (survival and reproduction) and learning methods that *quickly* develop these adaptive behaviours. We will come back to RL in the 4th part of this book but before we do we want to ground ourselves in a general optimization perspective. We will start with supervised learning which is very easy to understand as an optimization problem and then proceed to unsupervised learning and extended reinforcement learning which both need some translation to be viewed as optimzation problems.\n",

        "So that works pretty well, but whenever the proposed step is in the \"wrong\" direction we don't make any progress towards a better $x$ value. So although propose and reject has a nice ratcheting feature, that is we never pick an $x$ value that is worse than the one we currently have, we can potentially waste a lot of evaluations on steps in the wrong direction. One clever idea here is to make updates in the opposite direction whenever the evaluation is less than the current level. If we do this there is the question of how far to step in that opposite direction. For now let's just try stepping as far as the proposed step but in the opposite direction. Let's call this a \"test and step\" approach since we always step, but which direction we step depends on our test point."

        "So that is more efficeint at first, but when we get close to the optima as a result of \"over-shooting\" we sometimes take steps away from optima. And, unlike propose and reject, test and step has no ratcheting mechanism, i.e. we will step to worse $x$ values. So test and step can get us in the neighbourhood of the maximum relatively quickly, but it does not work so well for dialing in the precise location of the maximum. We could fiddle around with step size to mitigate this issue, but we will always face some tradeoff, where large step sizes are helpful in the beggining to quickly get in the rough neighbourhood of the maximum, but smaller step sizes are better once we are close to the maximum to dial in the optima precisely."

        "One way to get around this issue is to think a little more about what we can do with the information gleaned from evaluating a proposed value. In propose and reject we just ask \"Is this better?\". In test and step we ask \"Is this the right direction to be stepping?\", but we can ask an even more nuanced question, \"Based on our a comparison of this proposed $x$, how does $y$ change with $x$ around the current point, and given this how far and in which direction should we step?\" Another way of saying this is: \"What is the slope of the line between my current point and my proposed point? I'll take a step that is proportional to the slope.\" That is we can use slope to address both how far to step and in which direction."

        "Wow, that works great. We always take a step in the right direction. The steps are big when we are far away from the maximum, and the steps get smaller as we get closer to the maximum, so that we aren't stepping very far away from it the maximum when we do overshoot it. Now, again if you ever took a calculus course, you might have guessed that the reason this works so well is that the slope between two close test points is an approximation of the derivative, and so when we take step sizes that are proportional and in the direction of the slope we are gaurenteed to take smaller step sizes as we approach the maximum. Also important, these gradient approximating steps will almost always increase the value, except in cases of overshooting which occur when we are closer to the maximum than our test step. However, if have a small enough parameter step size we will not overshoot by much and we will correct on the next step. And if we have a small enough test step size this will only happen when we are very close to the maximum. To get a sense of how both test step size and parameter step size matter, use the sliders to play with these two step size parameters in the widget below."

        "In previous chapters we motivated much of our modeling using a binary classification problem in which a lurking predator must choose between striking and not striking based on sensory input. Initially, we viewed the behavioral map from sensory input to action as genetically determined. However, we concluded the chapter on evolution by highlighting the evolutionary advantage of at least partially learning these sensory-behaviour maps within an organism's lifetime. These advantages emerge in part due to variable environments and complex behaviors with non-linear fitness impacts. Here we shift our focus and work with the case where the behavioural map from sensory input to action is to be entirely 'learned' by the organism, using feedback signals from the environment. We will use and extend the fundamental optimization concepts just introduced. But, before we build a highly abstracted model of a neural circuit together with a learning/optimization rule to solve this problem, let's see if your neural network is up to the task. Given a sensory input pattern, determine whether to strike or not. Try to maximize your average score and see how well you can perform. We will start with a very simple 'sensory' pattern.\n"

        "***Note on Terminology:*** In a Supervised Learning context what we have been thinking of as the inputs to a sensory-behaviour circuit are called **features**. In a statistical/regression/experimental context these features or inputs are thought of as the independent variables or regressors. The 'correct' behavioural output is called the **label** or **target** in a supervised learning ML context, or the dependent variable in a statistical/regression/experimental context. Supervised Learning revolves around the concept of feature-label or $(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$ pairs. The basic goal of Supervised Learning is to discover the rule or process that generates these pairs, or a good approximation of it, solely by examining examples. The set of examples that we have to learn the rule from is called the **training set**. We will use the terms features and label when we want to emphasize the abstract algorithm and learning problem, and the terms sensory-input and target behaviour when we want to emphasize the embodied neural context of the problem."

        "In our specific example (on the specific COLAB instance we're writing this on in 2024), the broadcasting approach in Python, using NumPy, is approximately 50 times faster than using for-loops. This is because for-loops in interpreted languages like Python incur significant overhead at each iteration, but also because potential dependencies between loop iterations limit parallelization. In contrast, broadcasting allows for vectorized operations, enabling parallel execution that can harness more of the underlying hardware's computational power. NumPy enhances this efficiency further by utilizing highly optimized, pre-compiled linear algebra libraries (primarily hardware-specific implementations of BLAS and LAPACK). The same principles apply (though are sometimes less critical) in compiled languages or with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation frameworks like JAX. Broadcasting or tensor notation not only improves performance but also maintains code brevity and alignment with mathematical notation. As scientists and programmers, we do not need to understand every detail of how the magic of computational parallelism allows for fast linear algebra, but it is crucial to appreciate the potential impacts on computational efficiency."

In part, this is because there are fewer calls to `eval_params` per iteration (2 instead of 3). Additionally, this is because the step size in parameter space remains relatively constant throughout the 'Propose and Reject' process, while in the 'Measure and Update' method, the step size in parameter space diminishes as the relative improvements in performance decrease. For these reasons, our initial hope that 'Measure and Update' might be more efficient that 'Propose and Reject' is not born out in this simple problem."

        "A couple things to think about here:\n",
        "1. In our 'Measure and Update' implementation above we make one perturbation and one measurement of change in reward for each parameter. What would happen if we perturbed every parameter at once and then made a single measurement of change in reward? There would only be two calls to `eval_params` per iteration, regardless of the number of parameters. Together these two `eval_params` would measure the combined effect of all the parameter changes on reward. As a result the estimated effect of any one parameter on the reward would be polluted by the effects of all the other parameter perturbations. Whether this improves or breaks the algorithm will depend on whether the efficiency from fewer `eval_params` calls compensate for the noise introduced, or if the noise make these faster parameter updates fundamentally unhelpful? In other words is it better to take more/quicker noisy steps in parameters space or fewer/slower steps in better directions?\n",
        "2. In the learning loops above the impact on reward for a perturbation is measured using the entirety of the data set available to us. In this example the data set is only ~1000 examples, but what if it consisted of trillions of examples, would it still make sense to use the entire data set to evaluate each perturbation or would it be better to evaluate parameter changes using a smaller sample from this data set? Using a smaller sample will often make evaluations faster at the price of introducing noise to the estimate of rate of reward change (on the full data set) with respect to parameter changes. Again, this is question of more/quicker noisy steps or fewer/slower careful steps in parameters space.\n",
        "3. In the learning loops above we measure the relationship between parameter changes and reward changes using a single perturbation, but could we make better parameter updates if we measured using many perturbations before updating the parameters? This would require making more evaluations per update. Whether is this is a good or bad idea again comes down to a question of more/quicker noisy parameter updates versus fewer/slower careful parameter updates. What is the right balance?\n",
        "\n",
        "For this very straightforward problem these questions may seem kind of beside the point. We have a good answer, and it didn't take too long to get, why worry about these details now? We don't really need to now, but as we'll soon see, these details become increasingly relevant as we work to extend this 'measure and update' approach to a more complex problem. Indeed, the trade-off between more/quick noisy steps and few/slow careful steps is one of the fundamental questions at the dark heart of Machine Learning."

        "One thing that could be holding back performance on this discrimination problem is that our algorithms are not capable of finding the optimal parameters for the given model, but... we don't really think that is the case here. Another possibility is that our simple sensory-behaviour circuit is not flexible or complex enough to fully discriminate between the two types of input. There is good reason to think that this might be the case. Our current sensory-behavioural circuit is effectively equivalent to logistic regression, i.e. each feature can either inhibit or potentiate striking behaviour to varying degrees, but there is no possibility for conditional interaction between features. By 'conditional interaction,' we mean a scenario where, for instance, feature 1 typically inhibits the behavior, except when feature 2 is positive, under which condition feature 1 becomes potentiating. These kinds of feature interactions are impossible in the current model. One way to allow for such interactions is to augment the base set of features with composite features, e.g. incorporate all the pairwise products of the existing feature set, so that instead of 65 features (bias included) we have $(65^2 - 1) = 4224$ features to work with. This could work, but what if we want something that depends on the interaction of more than 2 features, adding higher order polynomial terms will quickly make the problem intractable (Reference appendix section on why hidden layers not polynomials if we do that). If we had some mechanistically grounded understanding or hypothesis about the relationship between the features and label could might be able to cherry pick some small subset of higher order interaction terms, but the ML/supervised learning framework is in large part about automating the feature selection processes based on the data alone. In turns out that instead of resorting the regression on polynomial terms to capture feature interactions, there is a much more compact and expressive way of allowing for feature interactions. The idea is to allow for feature interactions to emerge as needed in a 'hidden' computational layer of our highly abstracted neurons."

This is because there are more parameters to figure out good values for. Consequently, function evaluations take a bit longer, and more significantly, we need many more function evaluations — an additional one for each parameter — in each iteration. With more hidden units and more time we can likely learn perfect discrimination, but it will take even longer (more than 5 minutes!)."

We can imagine a scenario where synaptic strengths between neurons in a circuit undergo small, transient perturbations. The brain might integrate and compare the performance of these perturbations over a learning episode (for example, a day) to previous performance levels. (Though, we leave aside the specifics of how this integration and comparison occur.)\n",

This concept, while still vague, suggests a mechanism of synaptic adjustment based on performance feedback.\n",

The number of learning episodes required for effective optimization grows with the number of parameters in a neural circuit.

This limitation is critical, as life simply isn't long enough to accommodate the learning episodes needed for such extensive optimization.\n",

Then subsequently, relatively slow learning processes could 'fine-tune' the neural circuit's configuration. However, as noted in our earlier discussions on evolution, changing environments necessitate that a significant portion of behavior must emerge from learning, thereby limiting the extent to which genetic predispositions can facilitate efficient and adaptive learning.)"
