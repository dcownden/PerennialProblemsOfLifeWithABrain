        "In the first part of the book we gained insight into what the brain is for: rapid acquisition of adaptive behaviours. Now that we know what a brain is for, we are going to start thinking about how it does what it needs to do. Instead of taking a bottom up approach grounded in observed physiological mechanisms, we are going to use a problem oriented, top down approach. That is, we will think about what problems the brain is solving and then survey the various physiological mechanisms that could feasibly implement algorithms that solve those problems. We will start with problems that are simple to understand from a statistical and mathematical perspective; a broad sub-field of machine learning known as supervised learning. Supervised learning problems take as given many affordances and abilities without obvious physiological implementations in the brain. Nevertheless, for simplicity and to build foundational understanding, we start with this class of problems and associated algorithms, drawing connections to physiological mechanisms where we can. As more elaborate learning algorithms (un/semi-supervised learning, complex reinforcement learning) and their applications become clear, we promise that an outline of the physiology of a unified neural system which feasibly solves the myriad statistical decision problems faced by living animals will emerge.\n",

In particular we view the evolutionary process as selecting both the intrinsic reward signals (i.e. which kinds of base sensory inputs are are intrisicially rewarding) and the neural plasticity rules through which the sensory to behaviour is updated according to these reward signals. We will come back to RL in the 4th part of this book but before we do we want to ground ourselves in a general optimization perspective.

Initially, we viewed the behavioral map from sensory input to action as genetically determined. However, we concluded the last chapter by highlighting the evolutionary advantage of at least partially learning these sensory-behaviour maps within an organism's lifetime. These advantages emerge in part due to variable environments and complex behaviors with non-linear fitness impacts. Here we shift our focus and work with the case where the behavioural map from sensory input to action is to be entirely 'learned' by the organism, using feedback signals from the environment. Before we build a highly abstracted model of a neural circuit to solve this problem, let's see if your neural network is up to the task. Given a sensory input pattern, determine whether to strike or not. Try to maximize your average score and see how well you can perform. We will start with a very simple 'sensory' pattern."

        "***Note on Terminology:*** In a Supervised Learning context what we have been thinking of as the inputs to a sensory-behaviour circuit are called **features**. In a statistical/regression/experimental context these features or inputs are thought of as the independent variables or regressors. The 'correct' behavioural output is called the **label** or **target** in a supervised learning ML context, or the dependent variable in a statistical/regression/experimental context. Supervised Learning revolves around the concept of feature-label or $(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$ pairs. The basic goal of Supervised Learning is to discover the rule or process that generates these pairs, or a good approximation of it, solely by examining examples. The set of examples that we have to learn the rule from is called the **training set**. We will use the terms features and label when we want to emphasize the abstract algorithm and learning problem, and the terms sensory-input and target behaviour when we want to emphasize the embodied neural context of the problem."

        "In our specific example (on the specific COLAB instance we're writing this on in 2024), the broadcasting approach in Python, using NumPy, is approximately 50 times faster than using for-loops. This is because for-loops in interpreted languages like Python incur significant overhead at each iteration, but also because potential dependencies between loop iterations limit parallelization. In contrast, broadcasting allows for vectorized operations, enabling parallel execution that can harness more of the underlying hardware's computational power. NumPy enhances this efficiency further by utilizing highly optimized, pre-compiled linear algebra libraries (primarily hardware-specific implementations of BLAS and LAPACK). The same principles apply (though are sometimes less critical) in compiled languages or with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation frameworks like JAX. Broadcasting or tensor notation not only improves performance but also maintains code brevity and alignment with mathematical notation. As scientists and programmers, we do not need to understand every detail of how the magic of computational parallelism allows for fast linear algebra, but it is crucial to appreciate the potential impacts on computational efficiency."

In part, this is because there are fewer calls to `eval_params` per iteration (2 instead of 3). Additionally, this is because the step size in parameter space remains relatively constant throughout the 'Propose and Reject' process, while in the 'Measure and Update' method, the step size in parameter space diminishes as the relative improvements in performance decrease. For these reasons, our initial hope that 'Measure and Update' might be more efficient that 'Propose and Reject' is not born out in this simple problem."

        "A couple things to think about here:\n",
        "1. In our 'Measure and Update' implementation above we make one perturbation and one measurement of change in reward for each parameter. What would happen if we perturbed every parameter at once and then made a single measurement of change in reward? There would only be two calls to `eval_params` per iteration, regardless of the number of parameters. Together these two `eval_params` would measure the combined effect of all the parameter changes on reward. As a result the estimated effect of any one parameter on the reward would be polluted by the effects of all the other parameter perturbations. Whether this improves or breaks the algorithm will depend on whether the efficiency from fewer `eval_params` calls compensate for the noise introduced, or if the noise make these faster parameter updates fundamentally unhelpful? In other words is it better to take more/quicker noisy steps in parameters space or fewer/slower steps in better directions?\n",
        "2. In the learning loops above the impact on reward for a perturbation is measured using the entirety of the data set available to us. In this example the data set is only ~1000 examples, but what if it consisted of trillions of examples, would it still make sense to use the entire data set to evaluate each perturbation or would it be better to evaluate parameter changes using a smaller sample from this data set? Using a smaller sample will often make evaluations faster at the price of introducing noise to the estimate of rate of reward change (on the full data set) with respect to parameter changes. Again, this is question of more/quicker noisy steps or fewer/slower careful steps in parameters space.\n",
        "3. In the learning loops above we measure the relationship between parameter changes and reward changes using a single perturbation, but could we make better parameter updates if we measured using many perturbations before updating the parameters? This would require making more evaluations per update. Whether is this is a good or bad idea again comes down to a question of more/quicker noisy parameter updates versus fewer/slower careful parameter updates. What is the right balance?\n",
        "\n",
        "For this very straightforward problem these questions may seem kind of beside the point. We have a good answer, and it didn't take too long to get, why worry about these details now? We don't really need to now, but as we'll soon see, these details become increasingly relevant as we work to extend this 'measure and update' approach to a more complex problem. Indeed, the trade-off between more/quick noisy steps and few/slow careful steps is one of the fundamental questions at the dark heart of Machine Learning."

        "One thing that could be holding back performance on this discrimination problem is that our algorithms are not capable of finding the optimal parameters for the given model, but... we don't really think that is the case here. Another possibility is that our simple sensory-behaviour circuit is not flexible or complex enough to fully discriminate between the two types of input. There is good reason to think that this might be the case. Our current sensory-behavioural circuit is effectively equivalent to logistic regression, i.e. each feature can either inhibit or potentiate striking behaviour to varying degrees, but there is no possibility for conditional interaction between features. By 'conditional interaction,' we mean a scenario where, for instance, feature 1 typically inhibits the behavior, except when feature 2 is positive, under which condition feature 1 becomes potentiating. These kinds of feature interactions are impossible in the current model. One way to allow for such interactions is to augment the base set of features with composite features, e.g. incorporate all the pairwise products of the existing feature set, so that instead of 65 features (bias included) we have $(65^2 - 1) = 4224$ features to work with. This could work, but what if we want something that depends on the interaction of more than 2 features, adding higher order polynomial terms will quickly make the problem intractable (Reference appendix section on why hidden layers not polynomials if we do that). If we had some mechanistically grounded understanding or hypothesis about the relationship between the features and label could might be able to cherry pick some small subset of higher order interaction terms, but the ML/supervised learning framework is in large part about automating the feature selection processes based on the data alone. In turns out that instead of resorting the regression on polynomial terms to capture feature interactions, there is a much more compact and expressive way of allowing for feature interactions. The idea is to allow for feature interactions to emerge as needed in a 'hidden' computational layer of our highly abstracted neurons."

This is because there are more parameters to figure out good values for. Consequently, function evaluations take a bit longer, and more significantly, we need many more function evaluations — an additional one for each parameter — in each iteration. With more hidden units and more time we can likely learn perfect discrimination, but it will take even longer (more than 5 minutes!)."

We can imagine a scenario where synaptic strengths between neurons in a circuit undergo small, transient perturbations. The brain might integrate and compare the performance of these perturbations over a learning episode (for example, a day) to previous performance levels. (Though, we leave aside the specifics of how this integration and comparison occur.)\n",

This concept, while still vague, suggests a mechanism of synaptic adjustment based on performance feedback.\n",

The number of learning episodes required for effective optimization grows with the number of parameters in a neural circuit. This implies that 'measure and update' perturbation-based learning cannot be the primary mechanism driving neural plasticity in large, complex neural circuits. This limitation is critical, as life simply isn't long enough to accommodate the learning episodes needed for such extensive optimization.\n",

Then subsequently, relatively slow learning processes could 'fine-tune' the neural circuit's configuration. However, as noted in our earlier discussions on evolution, changing environments necessitate that a significant portion of behavior must emerge from learning, thereby limiting the extent to which genetic predispositions can facilitate efficient and adaptive learning.)"
