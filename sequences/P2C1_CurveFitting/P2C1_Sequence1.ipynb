        "In the first part of the book we gained insight into what the brain is for: rapid aquisition of adaptive behaviours. Now that we know what a brain is for we are going to start thinking about how it does what it needs to do. Instead of taking a bottom up approach grounded in observed physiological mechanisms, we are going to use a problem oriented, top down approach. That is, we will think about what problems the brain is solving and then survey the various physiological mechanisms that could feasibly implement algorithms that solve those problems. We will start with the problems that are most simple to understand from a statistical and mathematical perspective; a broad sub-field of machine learning known as supervised learning. Supervised learning problems in ML presuppose many features which do not always have immediate and obvious physiologically counterparts in the brain. Nevertheless we will draw connections where we can, and promise that as more elaborate learning algorithms and their applications become clear, so too will the possible physiological implementations of unified neural system which feasibly solve the myriad statistical decision problems faced by living animals.  \n",

        "In our last chapter on evolution, we motivated much of our modeling using a binary classification problem in which a lurking predator had to choose between strking and not striking based on sensory input. Initially we concieved of that behavioural map from sensory input to action as being genetically determined, but we concluced that last chapter with arguments for the (evoluationarily adpative) value of having such behavioura maps (at least partially) learned within an organisms lifetime, namely, variable environments, and complex behaviours with non-linear effect on fitness. Here we shift our focus, and work with the case where the behavioural map from sensory input to action is to be entirely 'learned' with-in the organism's lifetime, on the basis of feedback signals from the environment. Before we start building a (highly abstracted) model of a neural circuit that can solve this problem, let's see if your neural network can solve the problem. Run the cell below to play a simple 'binary discrimination game'. Given a senory input pattern, determine whether to strike or not. So how high you can get your average score over 20 trials."

But, if we can't do this with our eyes and brains can we at least come up with a way to program an algorithm that will learn how to do it. I think we can. We pulled the data set that underlies this strike-no-strike decision problem from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Alpaydin,E. and Kaynak,C. (1998). https://doi.org/10.24432/C50P49.) Let's take a quick look at the data before we start coming up with a simple machine learning algorithm to correctly seperate the cases when we should strike from when we should not."

But right now, in this moment we are not scientists seeking understanding, we are algorithm desigbers who just want to figure out how to do the right thing. We want come up with a process for 'learning a function' that takes these features in as inputs and generates the correct behaviour (as defined by the labels) as (behavioural) outputs. A zero label means no strike is the right thing to do (no prey present) and a one label means striking is the right thing to do (prey are present).\n",

Due to the stochastic spiking of neurons, in any given episode of behaviour production followed by contingent reward, some but not all of the synaptic weights are causally implicated in the production of the behaviour (and consequent reward). When a good thing happens, synaptic connections that were involved in the generation of the behaviour should be strengthened, and conversely when bad things happen synaptic connections that were invlvoved in the generation of the behaviour should be weakened. Synaptic connections that were not involved in producing the behaviour should be left unchanged. Zooming in to the synatic level the four cases above are expanded as follows:\n",

So our rule needs to prescribe no change, unless both pre- and post- synaptic neurons have fired. If a good thing happens, then the connection should be reinforced, and if a bad thing happens the  and strengthen the  We write our rule loosely inspired by the 'REINFORCE' alogorithms presented in [cite willaims]\n",

        "\n",
        "In the first plot \"Mean Score Over Generations\", we see a clear trend: stable environments lead to higher and more rapidly stabilizing mean scores (blue line, change rate = 0.00, orange line, change rate = 0.01). As the environment's change rate increases (red and green lines), mean scores become more erratic and generally lower. This aligns with the expectation that optimization through evolution will always lag behind in dynamic environments where the 'ideal phenotype' can change from generation to generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second plot, \"Mean Flexibility (Change Eligible) Over Generations\", tracks the evolution of the mean proportion of learning-determined loci, for those loci associated with fluctuating environmental targets (there are 10 such loci in these particular simulations). The plot shows a higher mean flexibility at loci where environmental targets change frequently (green, 0.1, and red, 0.5, lines) compared to loci with slow or no change (orange, 0.01, and blue, 0.0, lines respectively). This suggests that learning is advantageous and selected for when environmental unpredictability is high, as it gives organisms a way to rapidly adjust to new conditions within their lifetime and thus reduces dependence on genetic changes over generational time to cope with environmental dynamics (so called adaptive tracking). When the environmental volatility is very high (red, 0.5) there is basically no evolutionary tracking of the variable environment, and learning/plasticity dominates. In contrast, at an intermediate level of volatility (green, 0.1) we see that a combination of adaptive tracking and plasticity is stable within the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"Mean Flexibility (No Change Eligible) Over Generations\" plot serves as a sanity check, confirming that where environmental targets don't change, learning is selected against. When there is no environmental variability full genetic determination is selected for.\n",
        "\n",
        "The overarching message from these simulations is clear: genetic determination is beneficial in static environments where the optimal phenotype is constant. In such cases the 'correct phenotype' can in some sense be known fully by the genome and so should simply be developed as rapidly as possible. In such cases learning and other forms of phenotypic plasticity that might slow development have no adaptive value. Conversely, in volatile environments, learning and plasticity can be selected for. Note that in these simulations all of the many mechanisms required for effective plasticity have been abstracted away, e.g. the details of how flexible development/neural plasticity, evaluation of different outcomes, sensing the environment, etc. is achieved is left completely unanswered and so these simulations serve only to hint at the kinds of scenarios when such mechanism could be evolutionarily favoured, without giving any consideration to the costs associated with developing and maintaining such mechanisms."

We also saw how within lifetime learning could be an adaptive response to dealing with environmental change and uncertainty. In the previous simulations the connection between a genetic change and the fitness increment was quite direct given the structure of the fitness score function (the sum of 'correct' alleles) and so as a result selection was able to (relatively) rapidly steer the population towards good phenotypes for the given environment. This is not always the case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Genes rarely operate in isolation. They are typically part of dynamic networks, engaging in a molecular dialogue to orchestrate complex patterns of gene expression. These networks shape the diverse phenotypes (traits) we observe, from physical characteristics to behavioural patterns. Pleiotropy, where a single gene influences multiple traits, and epistasis, where the effect of one gene is significantly shaped by others, are the norm rather than the exception. Consequently, most traits are polygenic, emerging from the collective influence of multiple genes. Note that in our models we rarely consider these complications, and for the illustrative goals of most of our models we do not need to. However, if and when the goal of modeling becomes quantitative prediction actual empirical gene frequencies, these details, in particular when they can and cannot be ignored in modeling, do become critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a moment now though we *are* going to consider how a very simplified form of epistasis can result in a fitness score function that is much more difficult for an evolutionary process to optimize.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will continue to use the 'strike-no-strike' decision problem but with some added complexity. We still consider an organism with $n$ chemosensory receptors, each corresponding to $n$ possible food/non-food chemical markers in the environment. However, now the functionality of these receptors is determined by $nk$ distinct genetic switches, represented as a bit-string $g$ of length $nk$ with every block of $k$ contiguous bits determines the efficacy of the receptor in the strike-no-strike game. Instead of thinking of each genetic bit as corresponding to the expression or absence of a receptor for a particular marker, we instead think of each genetic bit as determining some connections in a neural circuit between receptors and muscles and only a very particular set of connections allows for the effective use of the receptor. In our learning simulations above we had a kind of epistasis where the the impact of the $g$ (preset) type loci was dependent on the the $f$ (flexibility) type loci. Here we have an even stronger form of epistasis where the fitness impact of any one $g$ type loci is fully dependent on the other genes that share its receptor block.\n",
        "\n",
        "In  the previous model having the 'correct' allele, i.e. $g_i = y_i$, at any loci, conferred a small, independent, additive benefit to fitness score. Now having the correct allele at a given loci, only provides a fitness score benefit if the other $k-1$ loci in that 'receptor block' on the genome also happen to be correct, otherwise the independent effect of that loci is neutral.\n",
        "\n",
        "Making the same rough interpretation as before when a given block of connections aligns with the target neural circuit configuration the particular behaviour the neural circuit governs becomes better suited to the environment with the resulting impact on fitness score. This gives us our single trial fitness score as\n",

        "In the simulations above we see the evolution of the (normalized) mean fitness score for different selection types, and different numbers of bits required to align before a fitness increment ([2, 5, 10, 20]). In each simulation there is mutation (but no recombination) to introduce new variance, yet the evolutionary process is unable to hit upon having all 20 bits in a receptor align at once (darkest lines) over 500 generations for any of these selection types. Fitness score functions like this, where a large co-adaption is required for any fitness increment, are sometimes referred to as 'needle-in-a-haystack' as there is one correct configuration, the needle, hidden among many, in this case roughly one million ($2^{20}$), incorrect configurations, the haystack. What makes this such a challenging problem for an evolutionary process is that all of the incorrect configurations look the same to selection; even though a configuration of one 'wrong' bit and nineteen 'right' bits is very close to the correct configuration in the genome space, from the perspective of selection, this close but wrong configuration is indistinguishable from any of the other wrong configurations. Selection gives no 'hot' or 'cold' style hints in this case to guide the evolutionary search. This is in stark contrast to the similar problem we looked at in the beginning of the sequence where selection was sensitive to every changing bit in the genome. For subsequent simulations we use 'proportional' selection, primarily for the sake of following Hinton and Nolan 1987."

        "Note though that even if the high scoring genotype is discovered through mutation and recombination, selection may not always be able to grow the frequency of this genotype within the population. Search and discovery with a so called 'flat' fitness landscape is just one aspect of the issue here. Additionally when using evolutionary search to find a large, tightly co-adapted configuration, recombination can be a liability. Consider that when this co-adaptation is discovered, if there is recombination then it is not easily passed on to descendants. When an adapted individual mates with any individual other than one almost identical to itself, the co-adaptation is likely to be destroyed by recombination. The crux of the issue is that for large co-adaptions very few, if any, improved genotypes are likely to appear in a given generation, and unless mating is strongly assortative these individuals are unlikely to mate with each other. For the co-adaptation to persist from generation to generation each good genotype must, on average, give rise to at least one good offspring in the next generation. If the dispersal of complex co-adaptations due to mating causes each good genotype to have less than one expected good offspring, the co-adaptation will not spread, even if it is discovered many times.\n"

        "To find the average number of generations needed for at least two 'genetic lottery winners', we calculate the probability of this event occurring in a single generation. This calculation considers the likelihood of having zero winners and exactly one winner. Then, we use the Taylor series expansion to simplify our expression, arriving at an approximate average wait time of $\\frac{2^{2k}}{N^2}$ generations. Specifically, with recombination the probability that any individual is a 'genetic lottery' winner is the $p= \\frac{1}{2^n}$. The probability of zero such winners is $(1-p)^N$ and the probability of exactly one such winners is $N p (1-p)^{N-1}$. Then using the same Taylor expansion as before and noting that $(1-p)^N \\approx (1-p)^{N-1}$ for large $N$ and small $p$, we have that the probability of there not being at least two 'genetic lottery winners' in a given generation is $q = 1 - (1-p)^N - Np(1-p)^{N-1} \\approx 1 - (1-Np) - Np(1-Np) = (Np)^2$. So on average is will take $\\frac{2^{2k}}{N^2}$ generations. We could be waiting a long time. Note though that this will be a slight over-estimate of the waiting time, as 'singleton' lottery winners will emerge occasionally, and over time they will seed the population with many similar and nearly adapted phenotypes, so that a) the probability of 'double winners' increases, and b) the probability of a 'singleton winner' having adapted offspring because they mated with a sufficiently similar non-adapted individual increase."

This aligns with our earlier mathematical predictions, yet these co-adaptations fail to spread across the population. Using the approximation from question 4 in the previous section, for a population with 1000 individuals trying to hit upon a 20-bit co-adaptation, the average waiting time until there are two adapted individuals in a single generation is roughly a million generations. If you have time on your hands you could adapt the parameters of the simulation and see how long you have to wait!\n",

(Though several simulations are required to check this alignment more fully.)\n",

        "In the cases with learning (bottom), the co-adaptation is discovered and spreads within tens, not thousands of generations. This takes slightly longer with recombination (bottom right), but not insurmountably so. Now comparing generational times directly is a bit misleading. In each generation with learning, (in these simulations) each individual could make up to 1000 distinct function evaluations, though given their learning rules they often made far fewer (distinct) evaluations. In stark contrast, in the simulations without learning each individual in each generation made exactly one function evaluation. So from a strict number of function evaluations perspective learning isn't really helping us directly, at least not in the simulations with no recombination.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our earlier simulations and mathematical models in section 1.3.2 demonstrated that recombination significantly accelerates evolutionary search in simpler fitness landscapes. However, in the context of more complex fitness score functions as explored here, recombination tends to be less advantageous, potentially even a liability, although learning can mitigate this to an extent. It seems as though the ideal situation would be to have a recombination structured in such a way that it both accelerated evolutionary search in some situations, without being an 'adaptive liability' in others. Indeed, this is precisely what we see in the natural world. In recombination, chromosomes are not shattered and shuffled and thrown to the wind all willy nilly, instead, specific break-points where cross-over style recombination events are more likely exist and are situated so as to preserve groups of tightly co-adapted genes. We will not explore this particular idea with simulations, but we can imagine how the genetic mechanisms for setting and maintaining good 'break-points' is itself the result of evolution. Aspects of life history and genetic replication that serve as the foundational assumptions of some evolutionary models, can themselves be understood as the results of evolution by natural selection. They key thing to keep in mind is that evolution is a 'black-box' optimizer, it has and uses no knowledge of the underlying structure of the fitness function, selection acts solely on the output of this function. (Or in some very real sense selection **is** the evaluation of the evaluation of the fitness function.) And so we expect all viable 'adaptive accelerators' to be deployed against 'the vague uncertainties of life'."

        "We conclude this section on learning and evolution by noting that we used a neural circuit as our motivating sketch of a highly co-adapted trait, and how this relates to lifespan. In an evolutionary context, a longer lifespan not only offers extended periods for learning and adaptation but also allows an organism to maximize the benefits of its investment in learning. This investment isn't trivial—it encompasses both the time devoted to learning and the sophisticated neural architecture required to support it. Our simulations further highlight that complex behaviors, which often involve numerous genetic co-adaptations, are challenging for evolution to both discover and spread within a population. Consequently, we expect, and generally observe, a confluence of extended lifespans, advanced learning capabilities, and complex behaviors in various life forms. This is because each of these traits supports and enhances the others, creating a synergy that is advantageous for survival and reproduction in diverse and changing environments. Brainy, motor-flexible animals, with rich senses exemplify this, and allow us to think about what brains are for in an evolutionary sense: learning adaptive behaviours quickly."
