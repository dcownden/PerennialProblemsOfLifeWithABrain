The book will start with evolution because ultimately, all aspects of the brain are shaped by evolution and, as we will see, evolution can also be seen as an optimization algorithm. We are sharing it now to get feedback on what works and what does not and the developments we should do.\n",

Now we start to use this perspective to show how the various supervised learning algorithms we explore might serve this adaptive purpose, and how these difference adaptive algorithms might correspond with physiological neural plasticity processes.  will now look at how much of machine learning Understand how supervised learning works. Aditionally, most (all?!?) of machine learning can be framed as extenstions or complications of basic supervised learning tasks. These techniques and ideas learned in this part of the book are foundational more general (and biologically relevant) problems investigated later in the book."
