Whereas previously we had only a single input, now we are going to allow for 64 different inputs. So our cartoon organism that inspires this problem can now be thought of as having 64 photo-sensitive receptors, and based on this combination of inputs it must decide whether to strike or not. As before, the organism pays a cost of one if it strikes when it shouldn't and recieves a reward of one if it strikes when it should. It receives no cost or reward when it does not strike. To get a sense of this more complex discrimination problem, try it yourself by running the code cell below."

This stochastic evaluation of the synaptic weights will make things difficult for the perturb-measure-step alogorithm, which relies upon precise function evaluations to get good estimates of the rate of improvement in a given direction in parameter space.

This is pretty good, better than we the humans were able to do in terms of figuring out the pattern, before we got bored of the problem in a few minutes. This is all well and good as an optimization exercise, but connecting this form of optimization back to our cartoon of neural behaviour, is a little off. There are three important aspects in which the perturb-measure-step training loop above deviates from a process that is simple and local enough to serve as plausible (even if very abstract) model of physiological syanptic plasticity processes. These key issues are\n",
        "1. The organism's striking behaviour of stochastic but expected reward outcomes, not actual obtained reward outcomes are used to update synaptic parameters $\\mathbf{W}.\n",
        "2. The evaluation of a given synaptic configuration is based on performance over all of the 5620 of distcint sensory-pattern, prey-presence pairs in our data set that define the environment, instead of on driven by reward outcomes over a single, or at least relatively few, stimulus-response-reward episodes.\n",
        "3. The organism would need to have distinct perturbation and non-perturbation modes of parameter evaluation to implement the training loop above, as contrasted with an ongoing evaluation and update mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are of course many other ways in which the this cartoon learning system deviates from what might plausibly be implemented in an actual simple neural system, but these have more to do with the abstractness of the model, and can concievibly be remedied with careful choices about how to make the model more concrete so as to map nicely onto measurable phyiological features of neural plasticity. In contrast, it is difficult to imagine how any of these key issues can be overcome physiologically, without invoking additional complex neural circuits and processes, the orgin of which also need to be explained. So for this sequence and the next we focus on addressing these core issues, different-modes, batch versus single experience based reward, and expected versus actual recieved (stochastic) reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the rest of this sequence we will adapt the base perturb-measure-step update rule to address each of these three issues. But first to get a sense of how these issues impinge upon the fantasy of our connecting perturb-measure-step with an algorithm that might feasibly be used by a living organism to update the connection strengths of this simple network determining behaviour in response to stimulous. In each interation in the vanilla perturb-measure-step training loop implemented above the organism first evaluates its current parameters based on the expected reward over all 5620 possible experiences. It then perturbs its perturbed parameters and evaluates its performance again on all 5620 experiences, these two evaluations are compared to determine $\\Delta R$ and this together with the pertrubations $\\Delta W_i$ determine the synaptic connections update according to\n",

        "Note that $s$ needs to be carefully choosen to account both for the average size of the perturbation $\\| \\mathbf{W} \\|$, the appropriately level of scaling given the expected alignment of a random perturbation with the gradient given the dimensionality of $\\mathbf{W}$, and the relative scale of the gradient.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process would require the organism somehow integrate all of the reward outcomes of all 5620 experiences, and then remember this aggregated outcome, while integrating up the reward outcomes of another 5620 experiences accumulated while in 'perturbation' mode, and then to update its parameters based on a comparison of the remembered and the recently accumlated aggregate reward outcome. This all seems a bit complicated, and difficult to implement with simple, primarily local synaptic plasticity mechanisms. What we would like intead is a version of perturb-measure-step that updates its synaptic weights as a result of every reward experience, doesn't rely on an expected reward calculation, and that does not have seperate perturbation mode.\n",

This particular idea for smushing together the perturbation and the update was is known as ALOPEX (an acronym from \"ALgorithms Of Pattern EXtraction\",  first proposed by Tzanakou and Harth in 1974.) This is one way of not having a seperate perturbation and non-perturbation mode. There are other ways, such as leveraging the stochasticity of relative spike timings (ref seung) and we will discuss these later, for now though it is enough to know that this issue can be mitigated, though with some apparrent cost to overall performance (relative to perturb-measure-step).

Even though what we are interested is the performance of the parameters over all of the input-target pairs in the data set, we could potentially have faster evaluations if we based our evaluations on a small sample of the input-target pairs in the data set, a so called mini-batch of the data. (As contrasted with the entire data-set a full-batch). These mini-batches would provide a (noisy) estimate of the desired full-batch evaluation. In the extreme case a mini-batch could consist of a single input-output pair (In ML contexts, for historical reasons, full batch learning is called lumped together with \"Gradient Descent\", learning with mini-batches of size 1 is called \"Stochastic Gradient Descent\" and learning with mini-batches of size greater than 1 but less than the full batch is called \"Mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent\", in practice, in ML mini-batches are almost always used, as they allow for the most efficient use of computational resources. Here though we would like to seperate the batch idea from Gradient Descent, and so will will refer to full-batch, mini-batch, and singleton based evaluations).

Another possibility is that our simple sensory-behaviour circuit is not flexible or complex enough to fully discriminate between the two types of input. There is good reason to think that this might be the case. Our current sensory-behavioural circuit is effectively equivalent to logistic regression, i.e. each feature can either inhibit or potentiate striking behaviour to varying degrees, but there is no possibility for conditional interaction between features. By 'conditional interaction,' we mean a scenario where, for instance, feature 1 typically inhibits the behavior, except when feature 2 is positive, under which condition feature 1 becomes potentiating. These kinds of feature interactions are impossible in the current model. One way to allow for such interactions is to augment the base set of features with composite features, e.g. incorporate all the pairwise products of the existing feature set, so that instead of 65 features (bias included) we have $(65^2 - 1) = 4224$ features to work with. This could work, but what if we want something that depends on the interaction of more than 2 features, adding higher order polynomial terms will quickly make the problem intractable (Reference appendix section on why hidden layers not polynomials if we do that). If we had some mechanistically grounded understanding or hypothesis about the relationship between the features and label could might be able to cherry pick some small subset of higher order interaction terms, but the ML/supervised learning framework is in large part about automating the feature selection processes based on the data alone. In turns out that instead of resorting the regression on polynomial terms to capture feature interactions, there is a much more compact and expressive way of allowing for feature interactions. The idea is to allow for feature interactions to emerge as needed in a 'hidden' computational layer of our highly abstracted neurons.\n",
