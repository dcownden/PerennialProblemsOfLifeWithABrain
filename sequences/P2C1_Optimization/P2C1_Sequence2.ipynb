In general when optimizing a function of $n$ values $x_1$, $x_2$, ... $x_n$, we will have system of $n$ equations to solve to try and find critical points (where all partial derivatives are equal to zero), and then an $n \\times n$ Hessian matrix, that needs to have its determinant evaluated at each of the critical points.\n",

        "For reference a polynomial like this one of the form $(a-x)^2 + b(y-x^2)^2$ is called a *Rosenbrock function*, and have a long history of use in developing intuition around optimization algorithms."

Dark blue indicates values very close to zero. Looking at the plot confirms that our analytic approach did indeed find a minimum at $(x,y) = (1,1)$. Now that we've seen how the analytic approach extends to 2-dimensions let's take a look at how our perturbation methods, propose and reject and perturb-measure-step work in 2-dimensions."

Start by clicking 'Propose' to sample a new proposed $x,y$ value. Then, decide whether to 'Accept' or 'Reject' the proposed point based on a comparison with the previous point. Your goal is to find the lowest point in of this curve. 'Show History' is turned on to start so you can see all of the previous steps in the process. You can also toggle on the 'Show Rejected' button to plot the points that have been rejected since the last accept."

        "Depending on the initial starting point, this can work pretty well, but as in the one dimensional case there are a lot of proposals that lead to no improvement. In particular, if the current point is in a narrow valley, with only a very gentle downward slope, but very steep sides, then there are relatively few directions that will lead to lower values, really only steps that are oriented with this valley. Thus, once the process is in such a location we expect there to be relatively many proposals for every step taken. And, as in the one dimensional case, because we simply either accept or reject, these rejected proposal points do nothing further to guide our search for the minimizing $x$ and $y$ values, so in a sense each rejected proposal is wasted computation. In the one dimensional case we used a pertrub-measure-step approach to overcome this computational waste, so that on each function evaluation we were able to make progress towards better parameter values. Now let's see what the perturb measure step approach looks like in two dimensions."

        "So this works much better than propose and reject at first, but then slows down terribly once the current point starts to be in a very narrow valley, with steep sides, the floor of which slopes downward gently in a North-Easterly (increasing $x$ and $y$) direction. The issue is that if we only step in the $x$ direction (East or West) we run into the wall of the valley and so only take a very small step. Similarly if we only step in the $y$ direction (North or South) we run into the wall of the valley and so again we would only take a very small step. We can continue to make progress, but it requires taking very small step sizes, which makes progress towards the minimum very slow."

        "In previous we introduced a visual binary classification problem in which a lurking predator must choose between striking and not striking based on sensory input. The basic problem is simple, given a sensory input pattern, in this case the intensity of a single pixel ranging from -6 to 6, determine whether to strike or not. The 'environment' of the organism consists of a data-set. There are 1125 elements in this particular data set. Each element is an $(x,y)$ pair, where $x$ is the sensory input the organism recieves, and $y$ is the correct action the organism should take. In the version of the proble we work with the organism gains a reward point if it strikes when prey is present, loses a reward point if it strikes when prey is not present, and obtains no reward if it does not strike (whether or not prey was present). You can try out this discrimination task for yourself by running the code cell below.\n"

        "So this tells us that there is likely a long flat ridge in the reward landscape roughly along the line $\\frac{b}{w} = 3.8$. In other words past a certain point it's really about the relative ratio of the $b$ and the $w$ values. This makes sense as it is the ratio of these two values that determines where the inflection point of the sigmoid is, and the relative magnitude of these paramters that determines the steepness of the transition from low to high probability as a function of the senory input signal. Looking at this countour plot of the reward landscape can make us more confident that we have found, if not the best possible values for $w$ and $b$, something that is at least very close to them in terms of the total expected reward achieved. Twiddling the dials though is not a particularly scalable optimization solution, so now we are going to see how our perturb-measure-step approach works when we are trying to optimize a decision rule that has two parameters instead of just one."

        "To adapt our perturb-measure-step from optimization in one dimension to optimization in two dimensions, we'll tackle each step of the process in turn, starting with perturb. In one dimension the only needed to think about how big our perturbation was and whether it was positive or negative. In two dimensions we need to think about how the perturbations of the different parameters relate to eachother, should they be the same size and in the same direction, or should they have different scales? One way of avoiding this issue is to apply our perturb-measure-step process to each parameter seperately, i.e. first to $b$, then to $w$. Again this raises another question, how many iterations of the process should we run on $b$ before switching to $w$ and vice-versa. There are principled ways of addressing these questions, and we will get to them, but for the moment we are just going to do simple things and see how they work. The simple thing we are going to do first is to alternate between taking one perturb-measure-step iteration with one parameter, and then taking one perturb-measure-step iteration with the other parameter. You can step through this process in the widget below."

In a statistical/regression/experimental context these features or inputs are thought of as the independent variables or regressors. The 'correct' behavioural output is called the **label** or **target** in a supervised learning ML context, or the dependent variable in a statistical/regression/experimental context. Supervised Learning revolves around the concept of feature-label or $(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$ pairs. The basic goal of Supervised Learning is to discover a rule or process, aka train a model, that makes a good prediction of $\\mathbf{y}$ given knowledge of it's associated $\\mathbf{x}$, solely by examining examples. The set of examples that we have to learn this prediction rule from is called the **training set**. We will use the terms features and label when we want to emphasize the abstract algorithm and learning problem, and the terms sensory-input and target behaviour when we want to emphasize the embodied neural context of the problem."

When using our perturb-measure-step process to optimize the total reward (given the specific set of features and data in our training set) when using a deterministic threshold rule we ran into one such issue. Reward for a threshold rule was a staircase function and so our perturb and measure process ran into issues, specifically the slope was estimated (correctly) as zero in many places, which was uninformative for parameter updates(Note that for small proposal step sizes relative to stair-step width of the $r(t)$ function our propose and reject algorithm will have similar issues. So now instead of a deterministic threshold, we are going to give our lurk and strike predator a probabalistic policy, one where it's probability of striking or not is determined as a function of the feature value. Then the reward will be a random variable, and the goal will be to find parameters for this probabilistic behaviour function such that the expected reward is as high as possible given the structure of the function, and the training data-set."

The reason for this is that unlike the polynomial we first worked with, this threshold based striking policy does not change smoothly in the average rewards. Rather, the reward is a step function of the threshold. THhis means that whole ranges of threshold values result in exactly the same average reward. There are ways of smoothing out such functions, but for now let's see if we can salvage our perturb-measure-step approach by taking perturbations that are big enough to step outside of the flat bits."

To overcome the flat step-wise nature reward as a function of threshold and make any progress we have to take big test steps, but big test steps ultimately limit how precisely we can dial in the actual optimal threshold value. This sort of fragility and fiddlyness is something that can be overcome, either by having test and parameter step sizes vary to match the scale of the reward function, in particular its step widths. In the next sequence we explore a powerful and widespread method of overcoming this kind of issue. For now though we conclude with the following thoughts."

We don't need to know anything about derivative or algebra to implement this, we just need to be able to evaluate differences in performance between two different points, and then switch when a new point is better than the previous best. This seems to be the minimum viable optimization process, and is roughly the kind of \"optimization\" that evolution by natural selection is performing, i.e. try new things that are slightly different from the previous things, select the things that performed better to continue the process with.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third approach was somewhere in between the two. We noted that the propose and reject approach can be very inefficient from a computational perspective; in our simple one dimensional problem on average half of all proposals were rejected. We came up with a middle ground approach that slightly extended the computational complexity of the propose and reject mechanism, instead of using the comparison between the new and old point to decide whether to jump to the new point, we instead used the comparisong between the new and old point to estimate the slope of the reward at the current point, and then step to a new point based on this slope estimate. We think of this as itermediate, because it uses (an estimate) of the gradient like the first analytic approach, but instead of requiring full knowledge and math super-powers, this approach only required slightly more computational complexity than propose and reject."

        "Our previous 'guess and check' learning method from sequence 1.3.4, while not the most efficient, proved effective, as were the 'propose and reject' style algorithms that we explored earlier and that are akin to what evolution by natural selection implements. Building on this idea of 'propose and reject' we will perturb the existing parameters by a small amount and evaluate the behaviour function using the perturbed parameters. However, instead of just simply accepting or rejecting the proposed parameters (kind of like natural selection does) we will instead ***measure the relationship between the change in the performance of the organism (in terms of reward obtained) and the changes in the parameters.*** An update will then be applied to the weights that is ***proportional*** to the ***measured performance changes*** over the ***measured parameter changes***, i.e. an estimate of the rate of change in performance for changes in the parameters.

This means that most of the information from evaluation is thrown away every time parameters are rejected. In contrast, a 'measure and update' method will always updated the parameters using the information gleaned from the tested parameters. However, unlike the 'propose and reject' algorithm it's possible that the updates made by a 'measure and update' approach do not actually improve performance.\n",

        "In our specific example (on the specific COLAB instance we're writing this on in 2024), the broadcasting approach in Python, using NumPy, is approximately 50 times faster than using for-loops. This is because for-loops in interpreted languages like Python incur significant overhead at each iteration, but also because potential dependencies between loop iterations limit parallelization. In contrast, broadcasting allows for vectorized operations, enabling parallel execution that can harness more of the underlying hardware's computational power. NumPy enhances this efficiency further by utilizing highly optimized, pre-compiled linear algebra libraries (primarily hardware-specific implementations of BLAS and LAPACK). The same principles apply (though are sometimes less critical) in compiled languages or with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation frameworks like JAX. Broadcasting or tensor notation not only improves performance but also maintains code brevity and alignment with mathematical notation. As scientists and programmers, we do not need to understand every detail of how the magic of computational parallelism allows for fast linear algebra, but it is crucial to appreciate the potential impacts on computational efficiency."

In part, this is because there are fewer calls to `eval_params` per iteration (2 instead of 3). Additionally, this is because the step size in parameter space remains relatively constant throughout the 'Propose and Reject' process, while in the 'Measure and Update' method, the step size in parameter space diminishes as the relative improvements in performance decrease. For these reasons, our initial hope that 'Measure and Update' might be more efficient that 'Propose and Reject' is not born out in this simple problem."

        "1. In our 'Measure and Update' implementation above we make one perturbation and one measurement of change in reward for each parameter. What would happen if we perturbed every parameter at once and then made a single measurement of change in reward? There would only be two calls to `eval_params` per iteration, regardless of the number of parameters. Together these two `eval_params` would measure the combined effect of all the parameter changes on reward. As a result the estimated effect of any one parameter on the reward would be polluted by the effects of all the other parameter perturbations. Whether this improves or breaks the algorithm will depend on whether the efficiency from fewer `eval_params` calls compensate for the noise introduced, or if the noise make these faster parameter updates fundamentally unhelpful? In other words is it better to take more/quicker noisy steps in parameters space or fewer/slower steps in better directions?\n",
        "2. In the learning loops above the impact on reward for a perturbation is measured using the entirety of the data set available to us. In this example the data set is only ~1000 examples, but what if it consisted of trillions of examples, would it still make sense to use the entire data set to evaluate each perturbation or would it be better to evaluate parameter changes using a smaller sample from this data set? Using a smaller sample will often make evaluations faster at the price of introducing noise to the estimate of rate of reward change (on the full data set) with respect to parameter changes. Again, this is question of more/quicker noisy steps or fewer/slower careful steps in parameters space.\n",
        "3. In the learning loops above we measure the relationship between parameter changes and reward changes using a single perturbation, but could we make better parameter updates if we measured using many perturbations before updating the parameters? This would require making more evaluations per update. Whether is this is a good or bad idea again comes down to a question of more/quicker noisy parameter updates versus fewer/slower careful parameter updates. What is the right balance?\n",
        "\n",
        "For this very straightforward problem these questions may seem kind of beside the point. We have a good answer, and it didn't take too long to get, why worry about these details now? We don't really need to now, but as we'll soon see, these details become increasingly relevant as we work to extend this 'measure and update' approach to a more complex problem. Indeed, the trade-off between more/quick noisy steps and few/slow careful steps is one of the fundamental questions at the dark heart of Machine Learning."

        "One thing that could be holding back performance on this discrimination problem is that our algorithms are not capable of finding the optimal parameters for the given model, but... we don't really think that is the case here. Another possibility is that our simple sensory-behaviour circuit is not flexible or complex enough to fully discriminate between the two types of input. There is good reason to think that this might be the case. Our current sensory-behavioural circuit is effectively equivalent to logistic regression, i.e. each feature can either inhibit or potentiate striking behaviour to varying degrees, but there is no possibility for conditional interaction between features. By 'conditional interaction,' we mean a scenario where, for instance, feature 1 typically inhibits the behavior, except when feature 2 is positive, under which condition feature 1 becomes potentiating. These kinds of feature interactions are impossible in the current model. One way to allow for such interactions is to augment the base set of features with composite features, e.g. incorporate all the pairwise products of the existing feature set, so that instead of 65 features (bias included) we have $(65^2 - 1) = 4224$ features to work with. This could work, but what if we want something that depends on the interaction of more than 2 features, adding higher order polynomial terms will quickly make the problem intractable (Reference appendix section on why hidden layers not polynomials if we do that). If we had some mechanistically grounded understanding or hypothesis about the relationship between the features and label could might be able to cherry pick some small subset of higher order interaction terms, but the ML/supervised learning framework is in large part about automating the feature selection processes based on the data alone. In turns out that instead of resorting the regression on polynomial terms to capture feature interactions, there is a much more compact and expressive way of allowing for feature interactions. The idea is to allow for feature interactions to emerge as needed in a 'hidden' computational layer of our highly abstracted neurons."

The number of learning episodes required for effective optimization grows with the number of parameters in a neural circuit.

This limitation is critical, as life simply isn't long enough to accommodate the learning episodes needed for such extensive optimization.\n",

Then subsequently, relatively slow learning processes could 'fine-tune' the neural circuit's configuration. However, as noted in our earlier discussions on evolution, changing environments necessitate that a significant portion of behavior must emerge from learning, thereby limiting the extent to which genetic predispositions can facilitate efficient and adaptive learning.)"
