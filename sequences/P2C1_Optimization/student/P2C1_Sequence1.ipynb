    "# **2.1.1: Optimization in One Dimension: Developing Intuition**\n",
    "In the first part of the book we gained insight into what the brain is for: the primary function of the brain is the rapid acquisition of adaptive behaviours. Now that we know what a brain is for, we are going to start thinking about how it does what it needs to do. Instead of taking a bottom up approach grounded in observed physiological mechanisms, we are going to use a problem oriented, top down approach. That is, we will think about what problems the brain is solving and then survey the various physiological mechanisms that could feasibly implement algorithms that solve those problems. We will start with problems that are simple to understand from a statistical and mathematical perspective; basic optimization and then a broad sub-field of machine learning known as supervised learning. To develop and ground our intuitions, in particular around problem scale, we start with some very simple problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our last chapter, 1.4 Life is Reinforcement Learning, we introduced the idea that within life time learning of an organism can be understood as solving a particular set of reinforcement learning problems selected for by the evolutionary process. In particular we view the evolutionary process as selecting both the intrinsic reward signals (i.e. which kinds of base sensory inputs are intrinsically rewarding) and the neural plasticity rules by which the sensory to behaviour function is updated using these reward signals. That is evolution selects for both the goals and the method of learning, choosing sensory grounded goals that guide behaviour towards being adaptive in the evolutionary sense (survival and reproduction) and learning methods that *quickly* develop these adaptive behaviours. We will come back to RL in the 4th part of this book but before we do we want to ground ourselves in a general optimization perspective.\n",

Whether it is a maximum or minimum is determined by the curvature of the parabola, which is given by coefficient $a$. Specifically, the vertex represents a minimum when $a$ is positive and the parabola opens upwards, and a maximum when $a$ is negative and the parabola opens downwards. The value at this vertex, $f(b) = c$, is thus either the maximum or minimum value depending on $a$'s sign. Virtually all practical optimizations problems involve constraints. With $x$ constrained to an interval, two possible cases arise. First, if the vertex falls outside this interval, both the maximum and minimum values within the constraints will occur at the boundary points. Second, if the vertex falls within the constrained interval, then either the vertex is a minimum (with $a$ positive) and the maximum value of the function will be found at a boundary point, or the vertex is a maximum (with $a$ negative) and the minimum value will similarly be located at the boundary.)\n"

    "Now, the analytic method above of taking derivatives, finding zeros, and checking concavity offers a clear solution to optimization problems. However, these sorts of computations are unlikely to serve as model of low level neural plasciticty, for several interelated reasons having to do with scalability, complexity, and information requirements, each of which we will unpack in more detail later. For now we take as given that something like analytic optimization is likely not what is happening in the brain. This raises the question of whether there are other more simple methods for solving this kind of problem, methods that are more likely to have clearer correspondence witht the physilology of th brain.\n",

Indeed, evolution through natural selection is roughly running a kind of propose (new variants through mutation and recombination) and accept or reject (through selective survival and reproduction) algorithm on the living world. To further develop our intuitions, let's apply this approach to our familiar optimization challenge of finding the value of $x$ that maximizes a quadratic function $f(x)$.\n",

Imagine synaptic weights between neurons undergoing slight, temporary adjustments. If these adjustments yield a positive outcome, they are reinforced and made more permanent, laying the groundwork for future experimentation. This is, admittedly, an oversimplification, but it outlines a process that aligns more closely with what is known of the underlying physiology of neural plasticity at the micro level and behavioural plasticity at the macro level: iterative, trial and error learning.\n",

Stepping through the process will give a feel for the iterative nature of decision-making. Start by clicking 'Propose' to sample a new proposed $x$ value. Then, decide whether to 'Accept' or 'Reject' the proposed point based on a comparison with the previous point. Your goal is to find the peak of the curve. 'Show History' is turned on to start so you can see all of the previous steps in the process. You can toggle the 'Show Function' button to plot the polynomial we are optimizing."

    "So propose and reject works pretty well, but there is a notable limitation. Whenever the proposed step is in the 'wrong' direction, we don't make any progress towards a better $x$ value. Although propose and reject has a nice ratcheting feature—that is, we never pick an $x$ value that is worse than the one we currently have—we can potentially waste a lot of evaluations on test steps in the wrong direction. To overcome this limitation, we can introduce a tweak: making updates in the opposite direction of a 'wrong' step. This tweak shifts our evaluative question from 'Is this a good new point to jump to?' to 'In which direction should I change the parameter?'. This shift helps us avoid 'wasting' unfavorable proposals. Specifically, by using every proposal—favorable or not—for guidance, this method ensures that each test step, regardless of its initial direction, contributes valuable information for parameter adjustment. However, this leaves open the question of how far to step in that opposite direction. For now, let's just try stepping as far as the initially proposed step but in the opposite direction. You can try out this modified version of the algorithm in the interactive widget below."

    "This modified propose and reject is likely more efficient at first, especially in moving quickly towards the general area of the maximum. However, an issue arises near the maximum value: the risk of \"over-shooting\" increases, and unlike the original version of propose and reject, this always steo method can sometimes step to worse $x$ values because it lacks a strict ratcheting mechanism. One way to mitigate this issue is to fiddle with step size, but in doing so we will always face a tradeoff. Large step sizes are helpful in the beginning to quickly get into the rough neighbourhood of the maximum and smaller step sizes are better once we are close to the maximum to dial in the maximum precisely. However, without a sense of how close or far away the maximum is, it is difficult to choose an appropriate step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that when we step in the opposite direction of the initial proposal, an additional function evaluation is required since this new point is not the same as the proposed point. So even though we take a step as result of every proposal, an additional function evaluation is required whenever we step in the opposite direction of the proposal."

    "# 2.1.1.3 Optimizing a Polynomial with Perturb-Measure-Step\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to get around the limitations we've encountered in propose and reject (and modified propose and reject) is to dive a little deeper into the insights possible from evaluating proposed values. Previously, with propose and reject, we only ask, \"Is this better?\" in modified propose and reject, this becomes \"Is this the correct direction for our step?\" However, we can pose and answer a much more sophisticated question using the same information: \"Given the comparison of this proposed $x$ to the current value, how does $f(x)$ change with $x$ near our current position, and based on this, ***in which direction and how far*** should we step?\" Essentially, this boils down to assessing the slope of the line connecting our current and proposed points and then updating $x$ in a direction proportional to this slope. In this way, the slope informs us not only about the direction but also about the appropriate distance of our update. We call this the perturb-measure-step approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach we ***measure*** the relationship between the change in the performance and the change in the parameter using a small perturbation as a test point. The update applied is then ***proportional*** to the ***measured performance changes*** over the ***measured parameter changes***, i.e. an estimate of the rate of change in performance for changes in the parameters or the slope. As a word equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Parameter Update} = \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Measured Perturbation in Performance}}{\\text{Measured Perturbation in Parameters}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is some constant of proportionality in this case usually called the learning rate or step-size meta-parameter of the learning algorithm. In the case of optimizing a function $f(x)$ this gives us\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{t+1} = x_t + \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{f(x_t + \\Delta) - f(x)}{\\Delta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\Delta$ is the small test pertubation applied to $x$ to measure the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand we might expect a 'measure and update' method to be more efficient than a 'propose and reject' method, because with a 'propose and reject' algorithm we don't make any parameter updates unless 'better' parameters are proposed. This means that most of the information from evaluation is thrown away every time parameters are rejected. In contrast, a 'measure and update' method will always updated the parameters using the information gleaned from the tested parameters. Note that because of this, in the propose and reject method, the test point step size and the parameter update step size are one and the same. In contrast in the perturb-measure-step approach the test step $\\Delta$ and the scaling factor of the step size $\\alpha$ are different quantities.\n",

    "Wow, that works great. We consistently move in the correct direction: taking larger steps when we're further from the maximum and gradually reducing our step size as we approach it. This ensures that even if we overshoot, we're never too far from the maximum, minimizing any potential backtracking. Note though that because we are never stepping to exactly our test point, each iteration requires two function evaluations, one to evaluate the new current location and another to evaluate the test point, that will inform the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those with a background in calculus, the success of this method might not come as a surprise. The slope between two closely spaced test points serves as an approximation of the derivative. By aligning our step sizes with this slope—both in magnitude and direction—we effectively harness the principle of gradient ascent, which naturally leads to smaller steps as we near the peak. This gradient-based approach ensures continuous progress towards a maximum, with the rare exceptions of slight overshoots when we're very close to the maximum goal.

This behavior, known as chattering, can still be acceptable as long as the process is overall converging on the optimal value.\n",

    "In previous chapters we motivated much of our modeling using a binary classification problem in which a lurking predator must choose between striking and not striking based on sensory input. Initially, we viewed the behavioral map from sensory input to action as genetically determined. However, we concluded the chapter on evolution by highlighting the evolutionary advantage of at least partially learning these sensory-behaviour maps within an organism's lifetime. These advantages emerge in part due to variable environments and complex behaviors with non-linear fitness impacts.\n",

    "Here we shift our focus and work with the case where the behavioural map from sensory input to action is to be entirely 'learned' by the organism, using feedback signals from the environment. We will use and extend the fundamental optimization concepts just introduced. But, before we build a highly abstracted model of a neural circuit together with a learning/optimization rule to solve this problem, let's see if your neural network is up to the task. In the simulation below, given a sensory input pattern, decide whether to strike or not. Try to maximize your average score and see how well you can perform. We will start with a very simple 'sensory' pattern.\n"

    "By playing with the threshold slider in the widget above you can see how there is a fundamental trade-off between missing opportunities to strike at prey and avoiding false strikes. This balance is crucial in binary discrimination tasks like the one we're exploring—and, indeed, in any categorization task. A key piece of feedback that can help us navigate this balance is the *confusion matrix*. The confusion matrix offers a comprehensive view of the decision rule's performance, going far beyond merely tallying correct and incorrect categorizations. Instead it shows exactly which categories are being confused with which. The confusion matrix, together with the relative rewards(costs) for the different types of correct and incorrect classifications determine what the optimal trade-off between missed opportunities and failed strikes will be.  \n",

    "This likely isn't working very well for you. The reason for this is that unlike the polynomial we first worked with, the reward does not change smoothly with the threshold used by the striking policy. Rather, the reward is a step function of the threshold. This means that whole ranges of threshold values result in exactly the same reward, and comparing points in these regions gives no guidance about which direction to step and how far (the slope is zero!). There are ways of smoothing out such functions, but for now let's see if we can salvage our perturb-measure-step approach by taking perturbations (test steps) that are large enough to ensure that our test point is never on the same step (flat bit) as our current point. Use the step size sliders in the widget below to see if we can make perturb-measure-step work for this problem."

    "So here we have a bit of an issue. To overcome the staircase like shape of the reward function and make any progress we have to take big test steps, but big test steps ultimately limit how precisely we can dial in the actual optimal threshold value. This sort of fragility and fiddlyness is something that can be overcome, either by having test and parameter step sizes vary to match the scale of the reward function, in particular its step widths. In the next sequence we explore a powerful and widespread method of overcoming this kind of issue. For now though we conclude with the following thoughts."

    "We touched briefly on three different approaches to optimization in this sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first was an analytic approach, in which we used total knowledge of the problem together with mathematical super-powers like taking derivatives and solving systems of linear equations to determine an optimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second was almost the opposite, a very simple try and see approach which we've been calling propose and reject. We don't need to know anything about derivatives or algebra to implement this, we just need to be able to evaluate differences in performance between two different points, and then switch when a new point is better than the previous best. This seems to be the minimum viable optimization process, and is roughly the kind of \"optimization\" that evolution by natural selection is performing, i.e. try new things that are slightly different from the previous things, select the things that performed better to continue the process with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third approach was somewhere in between these two. We noted that the propose and reject approach can be very inefficient from a computational perspective; in our simple one dimensional problem on average half of all proposals were rejected. We came up with a middle ground approach that slightly extended the computational complexity of the propose and reject mechanism. The new approach which we called perturb-measure-step, used the comparison between the new and old point to estimate the slope of the reward at the current point, and then step to a new point based on this slope estimate. We think of this as intermediate between the analytic approach and propose and reject, because like the analytic approach it uses the gradient, but instead of requiring full knowledge of the reward function being optimized and math super-powers, this approach only required slightly more computational complexity than propose and reject to create local knowledge of the reward function in the form of a comparison between the current point and a nearby test point in parameter space."
