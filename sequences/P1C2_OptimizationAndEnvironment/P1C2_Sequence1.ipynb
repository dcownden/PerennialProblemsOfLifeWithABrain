Our best score out of 10 simulation runs? The highest low score out of 100 simulation runs? The highest average score over 10, 100, 1000 simulation runs? The policy that achieves one of these goals might not be the same as the policy that achieves another of these goals, so we need to choose. A well defined evolutionary process often implies a specific goal, but we don't have a well defined evolutionary process just yet so instead we're going to have to just pick something. For now we're going to go with maximizing the ***expected*** score. This means the goal is to have a policy with a high average score over many simulations."

        "The expectation of a random variable is connected to the mean of a set of samples of that variable by teo important theorems in probability theory called the Law of Large Numbers. Specifically, the sample mean can be made arbitrarily close to the true expected value of the random variable from which the samples are drawn by making the sample size larger and larger. Imagine flipping a fair coin. Even though the chance of getting heads is 50%, in just 10 flips, there could easily be 7 heads and 3 tails just due to randomness, and 70% heads is very different from the true expected value of 50%. But, flip that same coin a million times and the proportion of heads will be much closer to 50%. In fact, after a million flips the proportion of heads will be within 49.4% and 50.6% with near certainty. Essentially, together the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem the more flips, the closer to that true 50% mark.\n",

        "**Answer** The simulations take longer to run, but the feedback is more consistent. This is due to an important theorems in statistics called the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that, for large sample sizes, the average (or mean) of the sample values will follow a normal distribution, centered around the true average of the entire population. Furthermore the variability (or spread) of these averages decreases as you increase the sample size. Specifically, the standard deviation of the sample mean distribution is close to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size. These means that with a sample size of 400 we expect the standard deviation in the feedback to be 20 times smaller than in the single simulation case."

We start with grid search."

        "# 1.2.1.2 Grid Search Parameter Tuning\n",
        "Grid search is both simple and computationally intensive, and so is often referred to as a 'Brute Force' method. The basic idea, in our case, is to think of the parameters of the policy as sitting in a 48 dimensional, real valued, vector space (one for each element of the weights matrix). In math symbols this is $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{48}$. We can make a grid over a plausible set of parameters in this vector space, and evaluate the performance of a policy with weights corresponding to each point on the grid. Grids of evenly spaced numbers in vector spaces of arbitrary dimension come up frequently in many applications, so there are nice libraries and functions to help us make such grids. Let's start by only allowing parameters to be one of three values, $0$, $0.5$, or $1$."

        "This should throw an error. The reason that the meshgrid function is throwing an error is because we are asking it to make a grid with $3^{48} \\approx 7.9766 \\times 10^{22}$ points in it. For context this is many orders of magnitude greater than the number of synapses in a human brain or the number of grains of sand on all the earth's beaches. More directly relevant, this is also much larger than the maximum number of float64's ($6.85 \\times 10^9$) that could theoretically be stored in 51 GB of memory (The memory provision of a 'High-Ram' Colab instance circa September 2023). It is simply not feasible for us to iterate through all of those grid-points. We can reduce our problem to something more tractable by enforcing symmetry (though maybe the optimal strategy isn't symmetric). Because Gridworld is symmetric and the organism is symmetric, it is plausible that a good weight strength between the 'near right' perceptive cell and the 'right direction' output neuron should be the same as the weight strength between the 'near left' perceptive cell and the 'left direction' output neuron, which should also be the same as between 'near up' and 'up direction' and the same as between 'near down' and 'down direction'. Generalizing this thinking we can apply rotational symmetry to reduce the parameters by a factor of 4, down to 12 and then apply flip symmetries (e.g. down and up perceptions should be treated the same for purposes of deciding to move left or right) to further reduce from 12 parameters to 8. In contrast $3^8=6561$ is not such a big number. This scale of grid easily fits in a (modern) computer's memory, we can readily work with it."

        "Even just considering three points per dimension and only evaluating each grid point using nine simulation runs, this looks like it is going to take about three minutes (on a default Colab instance circa September 2023). If we want to get a better result from this grid search approach we are going to have to both increase the resolution of the grid, and do a better evaluation of each grid point. Edit your solution and the grid definition cell above to increase the grid resolution to 5 points ranging from -1 to 1, and to evaluate each grid point with 25 simulations runs (hint edit batch_size). What does this do to the expected time to complete? This could take awhile so keep reading while you wait for this grid search to complete. You can also cancel the execution of this cell by clicking the square 'stop' symbol to the upper right of the code cell (Colab) or going to the `Runtime` drop-down and selecting `Interrupt execution`."

        "## Algorithmic Thinking Exercise: Curse of Dimensionality, Combinatorial Explosion, and Memory\n",
        "Although the grid search idea is simple, 'evaluate all the possible options and pick the best one', from a practical perspective it suffers from what is called the **Curse of Dimensionality**. When 'all possible options' are derived from a combination of parameters in different dimensions, even if we consider only a very small number of possible values in each dimension, the total number of combinations to be explored is the product of the number of parameters to be considered in each dimension. This number of all possible combinations can thus grow very quickly as the number of points per dimension increases, so much so, that it is often referred to as a **combinatorial explosion**. As a result, approaches to finding good parameters using grid search can only ever be effective if the number of dimensions being considered is very low (or if selecting parameters before the heat-death of the universe is not a concern)."

(If you're running this notebook locally you can use 'top' or similar in a linux environment, or the task manager in windows). Next increase the number of points considered from $3$ to $10$, and run the cell again, still observing the memory usage. This is the combinatorial explosion in action! What number do you need to go to crash your Colab instance (or start using swapon you local machine? Swap is when your computer runs out space in memory (RAM) and starts to use the disk as 'fake' RAM, which is usually an order of magnitude slower to read an write from, and will considerably slow most processes.)."

So, instead of laboriously iterating through a vast array of combinations, we'll 'test' parameter combinations (one at a time) that are close to the best known set of parameter values. If these proposed test parameters outperform relative to the current best parameters they are 'accepted' and become the new best parameters. If the test parameters underperform relative to the current best parameters they are 'rejected' and forgotten. After some fixed number of tests are rejected in a row we will say that the process has 'converged'. Let's make this."

        "1. `max_rejected` determines how persistent the algorithm is in testing for better parameters before 'giving up' and accepting an answer. If `max_rejected` is too high the algorithm will take additional time to stop. On the other hand if `max_rejected` is too low, the algorithm might not search adequately for improvements and could stop prematurely, settling for a suboptimal solution.\n",
        "2. The value of step_scale influences the speed of convergence towards optimal parameters. If it's too small, the algorithm will inch towards a solution very slowly. Additionally, if the evaluation function is stochastic then the inherent variation in the evaluation function will overwhelm any changes in performance due to very small parameter changes, which will make improvement impossible. An excessively large step_scale can make the method act like it's randomly sampling the parameter space since the guidance from the current best parameters becomes less relevant. A large `step_scale` is less of an issue in this context since the soft-max normalization means that good solutions are possible at many different scales of parameters, i.e. the relative proportions of the weights far more important than the order of magnitude of the weights."

        "In this particular problem, we observed that setting `max_rejected` too low can lead to catastrophic failure, i.e., a good solution is never found. In contrast, setting `max_rejected` too high primarily results in taking longer to identify a solution. So, in this kind of problem, it's better err on the side of setting `max_rejected` too high. Similarly, we can see that setting `step_scale` too small can lead to failure. This could be because the stochasticity of the feedback function is overwhelming the signal from parameter changes, or because the process is caught in a local minima, and small step sizes do not allow it to escape. On the other hand, due to softmax normalization, setting high `step_scale` values doesn't seem too problematic, though with very large step sizes it may be difficult to really 'dial in' a good solution, i.e. the parameters will be close to optimal but unable to settle in on a precise peak due to the large step scale. Therefore, in a problem like this, where the parameter scale can roughly adapt to the step scale, it's better to err on the side of setting `step_scale` higher."

Plants, too, display varied symmetries, from the radial symmetry of flowers to the repetitive patterns of leaves and branches. However, within these symmetrical development regimes, localized adaptivity breaks perfect symmetry. Take an oak tree, for instance. Each leaf follows the same developmental program encoded in its DNA. Yet, due to local conditions such as sunlight, moisture, and space, some leaves grow large, while others remain small. The developmental program for each leaf might be identical, but diverse outcomes can still arise from localized conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This widespread symmetry in morphology is possible because cell structures in distal parts of the body can be intrinsically 'linked' by executing the same (or similar) developmental programs encoded in identical copies of DNA. Yet, just as with oak tree leaves, localized conditions and adaptions can lead to deviations from symmetry. As another example consider a person doing bicep curls with just one arm - over time, one arm becomes more muscular, breaking the bilateral symmetry typical in human bodies.\n",
        "\n",
        "In neural systems, the applicability of symmetry is even more nuanced. On the surface, mammalian nervous systems, with their two brain hemispheres, might suggest that symmetry also governs neural systems. But, beyond the macro morphology and into the functional intricacies of the brain, the symmetry appears to break down. At a functional level, neural structures arise not just from pre-programmed ontogenetic processes but also—and often predominantly—from adaptive learning processes. These learning processes, dynamic adaptive adjustments in synaptic connections made in response to experience and environmental inputs, are inherently localized. Consider, does mastering writing with the right hand automatically confer equal proficiency to the left? Not really. Yet, does this deviation from symmetry imply its complete absence? Not quite. While the neural structures in the motor cortex governing the left and right hands will have followed different learning trajectories, the rules of neural plasticity guiding these trajectories are likely consistent. So, at this level of neural functionality, while we may not see direct physiological symmetry, shared plasticity rules between structures can be thought of as another, albeit more abstract, form of symmetry."

        "This concludes our introductory sequence on optimization. We learned about a few very basic optimization methods, and saw that while grid search was not powerful enough to solve our problem, a simple propose and test method was. We also looked into the importance of hyper-parameters in optimization processes. In the next sequence we will see just how robust this propose and test method is, looking at how it can be used to optimize a policy (behaviour) across of variety of environments, each with its own challenges."
