Optimization in a very strict and narrow sense does not directly apply to situations with multiple interacting organisms, each with their own goals that they are simultaneously optimizing for. In these cases optimization needs to be augmented with ideas from Game Theory and dynamical systems. Practically speaking a naive optimization mindset is often sufficient so in the chapter we will focus on understanding when and how a naive optimization perspective will lead to bad science and when it will be fine. In an appendix we will spend a bit of time laying out how to do multi-organisms \"optimization\" right, using dynamical systems, but actually for most of this book we won't need that.

In cases like this the parameterized policy acts on nearby relevant info in the same way as the more complicated policy. In other cells like (1,3) the two polices are very different and this can be chalked up to the fact that the parameterized policy has limited perception and so cannot navigate efficiently to distant food. In this cell (1,3) its perceptual field is empty, in contrast GW7x7-10-30 'sees' the whole board and so knows how to move towards distant food. However, in yet other cells, like (4,5), more interesting differences appear. The parameterized policy is inherently a short term maximizer, and so it moves immediately towards the food at (6,5). In contrast GW7x7-10-30 has learned to sometimes forgo immediate reward to 'set itself up' for an efficient series of moves, and so moves to (5,6) after which it will be able to make (at least) four eating moves in a row.

It is worth noting that \"memory\", especially in straightforward cases like this, need not be solely dependent on an internal neural state. Instead, memory might also be fully or partially embedded in an organism's movement mechanics. For instance, \"memory\" could be an orientation in relation to the direction of motion, with new decisions based on this relative orientation. Regardless of the mechanism, some ability to integrate the past can be beneficial.\n",

        "So far, when we have compared policies, each organism has been contentedly pursuing its objectives in its own personal private Gridworld universe, and we have assessed the efficiency of each organism acting in isolation. However, for many organisms, a key aspect of life is competitionâ€”specifically, competition for limited resources critical to survival and replication, such as food, viable nesting sites, and mating opportunities. Competition can occur between conspecifics or organisms of different species. For example, individuals of a prey species may compete among themselves to avoid being eaten by a predator while also competing directly with individuals of the predator species over who gets eaten and who goes hungry.\n",
        "\n",
        "To explore how competition might affect performance, we now modify Gridworld to include two different organisms that take turns moving (and eating if they land on food, they do not eat each other yet). Food is immediately replenished after being consumed; strictly speaking, it is not more scarce. However, the presence of two organisms pursuing the same goal does create a more complex environment with new dynamics. In this multi-organism Gridworld, organisms are not allowed to move onto a space already occupied by another organism, much like they can't move off the board.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's observe what happens when GW7x7-10-30 and the 'Parameterized Weights' policy compete directly in this shared environment. For now, neither policy perceives the other organism. Specifically, each organism perceives the grid cell occupied by the other organism as empty when initially determining action probabilities; that is they employ the same policies as they did in the single-organism version of Gridworld. However, these initial action probabilities are now re-normalized over valid movement options to avoid moving onto the grid cell occupied by the other organism."

        "Just watching a few simulations it's difficult to pin down whether sharing the environment is a net positive or negative for these policies. Sometimes a shared environment can make the policies more efficient, like when one organism eating food makes new food appear closer to the other organism. In other instances though, the two organisms, being unaware of each other, pursue the same food and end up getting in each other's way, depleting the immediately available food more quickly. Specifically, this version of GW7x7-10-30 does not take into account another organism. So, sometimes when GW7x7-10-30 forgoes immediate reward to 'set up' a series of efficient eating moves, the other organism swoops in, eats the food, and wrecks the plan.\n",

        "This concludes the sequence on abstraction and reasoning about policies. By thinking of policies as functions that turn environmental inputs into behavioural outputs, we directly compared policies to see in which contexts they were the same and in which contexts they differed. As another form of more direct comparison, we looked at two organisms sharing, and to some extent competing, in the same environment. We saw that policies that had worked well in isolation did not always work quite so well in this new shared environment; a good policy for one environment might not be so great in another. The environment isn't just a static thing, but potentially a rich dynamical system dependent on the variety of organisms that live there. So, this grand challenge of biology and evolutionâ€”setting up policies that work in the real worldâ€”is even trickier than it might seem at first."
