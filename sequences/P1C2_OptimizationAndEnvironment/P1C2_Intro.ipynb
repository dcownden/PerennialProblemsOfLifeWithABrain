    "The following is part of a test for an upcoming text book on computational neuroscience from an optimization and learning perspective. The book will start with evolution because ultimately, all aspects of the brain are shaped by evolution and, as we will see, evolution can also be seen as an optimization algorithm. We are sharing it now to get feedback on what works and what does not and the developments we should do."

    "### Objective: In the previous chapter we learned to describe and think about behaviour as a policy and to evaluate an organism's behaviour relative to the goals implied by the organism's environmental niche. In this next chapter we are going to really focus on ***Optimization***, different ways of making a policy better, different ways an organism might become better suited to its niche.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn:\n",
    "*   How to more formally define an objective function. In the last chapter our policy goals were loosely stated as 'eat lots of food'. In this chapter we will better formalize goals, eventually using mathematics and the Markov Decision Process framework, so that these goals can directly guide policy improvement.\n",
    "*   Different optimization methods. There are many different methods for modifying a policy to improve its performance, and we will begin to explore a few of these (guess and check, grid search, propose and test).\n",
    "*   Normative Thinking - How optimization can be used descriptively, prescriptively, and predictively in different context, and how to keep track of which contexts are appropriate for optimization as description, perscription and prediction.  "
