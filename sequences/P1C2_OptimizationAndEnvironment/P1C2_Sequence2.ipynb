        "To add some (easily parameterized) variation to our environment we are going to increase the complexity of Gridworld by allowing food to drift. Specifically, after an organism has determined its move, each piece of food has a probability of drifting in one of four directions (up, down, left, right). After this drift the organism makes its move. Different drift probabilities will generate distinct Gridworld variants. Our original Gridworld can be seen as a special case of this new version, where the probability of food drifting in any direction is set to zero. Let's look at how our 'parameterized weights' policy from the previous sequence, optimized for our original Gridworld, performs in both the original Gridworld, and in a new variant of Gridworld where food consistently drifts to the left."

        "In many ways this new drifting food environment is 'unfair' for our policy from last time. One particularly 'unfair' aspect is the sequence of events in this new Gridworld: first the organism decides its move based on its perceptions, then the food drifts, and only after that does the organism move. This sequencing can lead the organism on a fruitless chase across the board, never catching its target. To be truly effective in this variant, the organism's actions must anticipate the potential movement of the food.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another 'unfair' aspect of this drifting food environment is its asymmetry: food consistently drifts to the left. Yet, the organism as optimized in the previous sequence, was constrained to have symmetric weights. We imposed this symmetry constraint in the last sequence to simplify our optimization problem, reducing the number of parameters to be optimized from 48 (12 inputs $\\times$ 4 output directions) to just 8. However, an effective policy in this asymmetric environment might need to break out of this symmetry constraint.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can our simple 'propose and test' algorithm from the previous sequence handle this higher dimension optimization problem (where the symmetry constraint is lifted)? Run the cell below to find out. (This might take a few minutes, so consider reading ahead while you wait.)"

        "Finding a good set of parameters in an 8-dimensional space was certainly easier than in a 48-dimensional space. However, given enough time and appropriate hyper-parameter settings, our simple 'propose and test' algorithm is up to the task. We just tested this optimization algorithm in the no-drift environment, but with the relaxed symmetry constraint. This tells us that it's a feasible approach for optimizing parameters even when the food drifts. So now, let's adapt our 'propose and test' process above to tune the parameters of a policy so that it performs well in an environment where food drifts."

        "he observation that a policy well-suited to one environment may not fare as well in another different environment might seem elementary. Similarly, the observation that many environments are perpetually in flux—where change is the only constant—may seem cliché. However, when these two basic truths are considered together, they begin to hint at the immense challenge of producing adaptive behaviors and phenotypes. This is the overarching optimization problem that both evolutionary and learning processes strive to address.\n",
        "\n",
        "To highlight this challenge, consider the following simulation/animation. It begins with an environment where food consistently drifts to the left. This then transitions abruptly to an environment where food drifts upwards, followed by a shift where food moves to the right, and finally, where it drifts downward. Throughout these changes, our 'propose and test' optimization algorithm continues to adjust the parameters. The animation below showcases two key aspects: how the policy parameters adjust to better suit the new environment and how the average performance score initially drops with each environmental shift, only to gradually recover as the optimization algorithm fine-tunes the parameters to better align with the current environment."

We used our simple 'propose and test' optimization method, and saw that this method was able to find good parameters across a variety of environments, but that the parameters that were good in one environment were not well suited to other environments. So the ***same*** optimization process applied to different problems (environments) produced different behaviours that were better suited to that environment. This underscores a universal truth in optimization and adaptation: solutions are intricately tied to the context in which they were developed.\n",
