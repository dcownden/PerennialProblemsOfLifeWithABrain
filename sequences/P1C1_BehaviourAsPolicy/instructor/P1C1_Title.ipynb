The book will start with evolution because ultimately, all aspects of the brain are shaped by evolution and, as we will see, evolution can also be seen as an optimization algorithm. We are sharing it now to get feedback on what works and what does not and the developments we should do."

In this first part of the book we set out this foundational perspective. Each subsequent part shows how this perspective connects insights from Machine Learning to the function of the brain in a way that can both synthesize and guide empirical neuroscience research."
