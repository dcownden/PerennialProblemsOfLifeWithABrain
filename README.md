# Installation:

We recommend installing the python virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv

Then, assuming you're in the root of the repo, switch to the virtual env:
source venv/bin/activate

Now install the packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you encounter an installation error, you may need to install pathlib directly:
pip install pathlib

Finally, you may want to install pytest to run tests:
pip install pytest
